In 2010, Joe Jonas opened up about losing his virginity at age 20 to Ashley Greene.
“I didn’t have any condoms, so I went to our drummer Jack’s room — who was my roommate at the time — and I demolished his room looking for them,” he said in a Reddit AMA at the time."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

While some celebrities keep their sexual experiences close to their chests, others have no problem kissing and telling about their first times.</p><p>In 2010, <a href=#><strong>Joe Jonas</strong></a> opened up about losing his virginity at age 20 to <a href=#><strong>Ashley Greene</strong></a>.</p><p>“I didn’t have any condoms, so I went to our drummer Jack’s room — who was my roommate at the time — and I demolished his room looking for them,” he <a href=#>said in a Reddit AMA</a> at the time. “[I] found them underneath his underwear drawer. When he came home, he thought somebody broke into his room because his whole room was demolished.”</p><p>The reveal was quite shocking to fans as the Jonas Brothers wore purity rings for years, vowing not to have premarital sex. In 2016, he stated that he didn’t regret <a href=#>sharing that personal experience</a> with the world.</p><p>“Life’s too short, you know?” the DNCE singer told Entertainment Tonight at the time. “I mean ultimately, I think of myself as an honest guy. There are just those moments in life where you have to be true to yourself and true to the world. … I’m not out to hurt anybody, but I think, ultimately, I’m just telling my stories and what I can say from my heart.”</p><p>Another former Disney Channel star that has been open about her early sexual experiences is <a href=#><strong>Miley Cyrus</strong></a>.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“I didn’t go<a href=#> all the way with a dude until I was 16,</a> but I ended up marrying the guy,” the singer said on the “Call Her Daddy” podcast in August 2020, implying that she lost her virginity to <a href=#><strong>Liam Hemsworth</strong></a>, whom she was married to from 2018 to 2020. “I lied and said that he wasn’t the first so I didn’t seem like a loser. He said, ‘Oh, who have you had sex with?’ And I couldn’t think of anyone, so I just made somebody up that I knew but we had never actually had sex before.”</p><p>Other celebs <a href=#>waited until much later</a> in life. <a href=#><strong>Adriana Lima</strong></a> didn’t have sex until marrying <strong>Marko Jarić</strong> in 2009. “Sex is just for after marriage,” she told <a href=#>GQ</a> magazine in 2006. “I don’t care [what men think about me waiting]. They have to respect that this is my choice. If there’s no respect, that means they don’t want me.”</p><p>From the extremely awkward to the really romantic encounters, see what the stars had to say about their first times:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S9qq%2FTrqmeq1%2BstaLAjJqenmWTmrmmrtJmo6irpGLBqbHIq2SvoaKctq%2B107Jka2hgbn52fY9oa29paQ%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
