Their relationship kicked off after Nicole messaged the Kansas City Chiefs tight end on social media.</p><p>“Slid into that thang like it was third base, idk baseball so not sure that’s the best analogy, but ya,” she revealed via Instagram in 2022. “Anywho … lesson here is making the first move might be your best move sis.”</p><p>The duo faced a rocky road near the end of their romance amid speculation that Kelce never paid for bills or dates while they were together. He denied the reports in early 2023, telling fans, “Don’t buy into that s–t.”</p><p>Nicole <a href=#>later shared insight</a> into her and Kelce’s breakup, revealing to People in October 2023 that she had experienced a “major breakup and major life change” the prior year. While she didn’t name Kelce, the model alluded to the split allowing her to devote more attention to her mental health. (Kelce has since moved on with <strong>Taylor Swift</strong>.)</p><p>“I had lost a substantial amount of weight within a very short amount of time. I wasn’t sleeping, I wasn’t eating. I was really abusing melatonin to sleep at night,” Nicole shared at the time. “I started going to therapy and quickly realized, ‘OK, it’s one thing to be physically fit, but it’s another thing to be mentally fit.’ You could be in the best shape of your life, but mentally, if you are not a healthy person, it’s not going to feel good.”</p><p>While she’s not interested in dating athletes anymore, Nicole made headlines in November 2023 for <a href=#>thirsting over Philadelphia Eagles</a> quarterback <strong>Jalen Hurts</strong>.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“Fly eagles fly,” she captioned an X video at the time, <a href=#>zooming in on Hurts</a>. When replying to commenters, Nicole added, “Y’all have eyes too. 😂.”</p><p>Hurts, 25, never publicly addressed Nicole’s comments. He has been romantically linked to <strong>Bryonna “Bry” Burrows</strong> since early 2023.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGatqpGrtrR5yp6jnJ2jYrK5ecaiqaWeop6yr7CMpJiypJFiu6qvzqWcZqGjYrGwusRmm5qsmaO0bq3ToaOerJWofA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
