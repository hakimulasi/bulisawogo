Unfortunately, they had to cancel these plans because the band was on tour.</p><p>“I have Chris Motionless singing my song right now. So, I would absolutely love the Motionless in White to perform me out to the ring. We were trying to do it for WrestleMania 39 but unfortunately, they had a tour in Germany, I believe, which was already rescheduled from the COVID era. So, they had to do that. They couldn’t pull out again.</p><p>But I’m hoping that maybe SummerSlam or some sort of PLE, they’ll be there to perform me out to the ring because I would love to be on the stage with my musically talented twin Chris Motionless and the rest of Motionless in White.”</p><p>Rhea Ripley decimated Natalya at WWE Night Of Champions last week and successfully retained her Smackdown Women’s Championship. We will have to wait and see what WWE has planned for her next.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><p>What’s your view on what Rhea Ripley said?
