I’ve been exercising every day for 30 minutes. It’s about consistency and everybody has 30 minutes in a day. We’re all busy, but I did that this morning. I did my 30 minutes, so I’ll slowly get there this time, but I think that’s the better way to do it. I am getting there though!”</p><p>The Bravo star further explained that she measures her <a href=#>weight loss</a> by how her clothes fit.</p><p>“I don’t weight myself because, you know, I’ve been told that muscle weighs more than fat, so I don’t wanna look at the scale. It’s about the clothes for me,” Beador said. “But I have gone down, I have gone down in pants size, so I feel good about that and I’ll keep going!”</p><p>The reality TV personality, who is currently filming season 13 of RHOC, also reveal whether or not she finds it difficult to maintain her diet while filming the series.</p><p>“Not when you have <a href=#><strong>Tamra Judge</strong></a> sitting next to you ordering everything with no salt! I can’t be ordering the stuff that she’s not,” Beador said of her fit BFF. “I’ll always think, ‘I’ll have what she’s having.’ We filmed two nights ago and she ordered and I said, ‘Just give it up!’”</p><p>Beador added that she knows she needs to live a healthy lifestyle for her daughters. (The Real Housewife shares Sophie, 16, and 13-year-old twins Stella and Adeline with her estranged husband,<strong> David Beador</strong>.)</p><p>“I understand what need to do and I want to be around for a long time for my girls and you know, I’ve been carrying this extra weight on and off for the last almost two years and I’m ready to get back to&nbsp;Shannon Storm Beador,” she explained.</p><p>The Southern California native also partnered up with QVC to create a healthy food line amid her <a href=# data-link=1>weight loss</a> journey.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“I don’t want to deprive myself and you can eat healthy food and it can still have flavor, so I created Real for Real Cuisine and QVC was interested in featuring it,” Beador explained. “We’re starting out next Wednesday, April 18, with three seafood items that I’m really excited about and they came from my recipes and then the chef… we tweaked them a little bit because the food is frozen, but you know, there are dishes that I’ve had for quite sometime.”</p><p>The Real Housewives of Orange County is set to return to Bravo later this year.</p><p>With reporting by Carly Sloane&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZJunlK58r7HWrGaroJ%2BYerTAwKtkrKCRo7uwuoybnJqcn6d6sLzEp6pmraBirqO71K1ksJ2ZnLW1ecuoqqxn</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
