He had two children, including actor, singer, and songwriter Chris Orbach, with his former wife Marta Curro.</p><p>Jerry had evidently stated that his father had Sephardi Jewish ancestry. It is not clear if this is accurate.</p><p>Jerry’s paternal grandfather was named Isidore Orbach (the son of Lesser Orbach and Annie). Isidore was born in Neustettin, Germany, today in Szczecinek, Poland.</p><p>Jerry’s paternal grandmother was named Bertha.
