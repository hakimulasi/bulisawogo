Home Entertainment provided me with a free copy of the Blu-ray I reviewed in this Blog Post. The opinions I share are my own.</p><p>We have a brand new giveaway for you all and this one sure is exciting. <strong>Daphne & Velma</strong>, from the hit series Scooby-Doo,&nbsp;are getting their very own movie. It will be distributed by Warners Bros Home Entertainment and stars Sarah Jeffery and Sarah Gilman.</p><p>The brand new film will be released on digital services, Blu-ray, and DVD on May 22, 2018. It is set before the Mystery Incorporated all got together. Little did we know that Daphne Blake, played by Sarah Jeffery (Descendants,&nbsp;Shades Of Blue,&nbsp;Charmed (2018 Series)), and Velma Dinkley, played by Sarah Gilman (I Didn’t Do It,&nbsp;Last Man Standing) previously met in school at Ridge Valley High. We watch as they take on a mystery where the top performing kids suddenly become “zombified” – where they become lifeless shells. Can this incredible duo work out what is happening, or will they be next?</p><p>The film contains a lot of laughs and is perfect for the whole family. It really has the air of Scooby-Doo whilst bringing the twist of something new and addicting.&nbsp;<strong>Daphne & Velma</strong> has been produced by Ashley Tisdale and Jennifer Tisdale under their production company Blondie Girl Productions. The director for the film was Suzi Yoonessi.</p><h3>Watch The Trailer To Daphne & Velma Here:</h3><p></p><p>Alongside the release of the film, there is also an awesome blog app that gives you plenty of exclusive content. We’ve been using it all day. There are two exciting parts to the blog app, there’s the Mystery Video Decryptor and then there’s the Soundboard.</p><p>The Mystery Video Decryptor shows exclusive clips from the film in a hazy, blurred, white-noise visual which you have to slide the filters to make clear. It’s a great concept and it’s definitely fun trying to work out how to clear up the picture.</p><p>As for the Soundboard, you can play fun and spooky sounds from the movie at a click of a button. We especially love how you can alter the sound using the pitch button.</p><h3>Click The Image Below To Play The Daphne & Velma Blog App:</h3><h3><a href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebmix.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/celebmix-giveaway-win-daphne-amp-velma-blu-ray-dvd-01.png alt width=518 height=620 sizes="(max-width: 518px) 100vw, 518px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></h3><p>That isn’t the only exclusive blog app content that has been released, there’s also been a Slime Lab blog video released. This video teaches all the viewers how to make <strong>Daphne & Velma</strong> inspired slime at home.</p><p>The video is presented by Sarah Gilman, who plays Velma in the show. She is joined by The McAlevey Twins, Rowan and Bailey. They teach you how to make different versions of slime including foamy slime, glitter slime, floam slime, and rainbow slime.</p><h3>Click The Image Below To Watch The Daphne & Velma Slime Video Below:</h3><p><a href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebmix.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/celebmix-giveaway-win-daphne-amp-velma-blu-ray-dvd-02.png alt width=518 height=428 sizes="(max-width: 518px) 100vw, 518px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p>Now time for the exciting part.
