The moment I admit to myself (and my friends) that I don’t want to go out is the moment I morph back into my truest form. The jeans come off, the hair goes up, and I get to mercifully fall back onto my couch — where I wanted to be all along.</p><p>If you were to ask an etiquette expert, they would say that a plan is a plan and it’s absolutely terrible if you don’t follow through. Society frowns upon <a href=# class=T3D>canceling plans</a>, especially if you do it at the last minute. But I’d like to argue that it’s almost always a good idea.</p><p>When you think about it, it’s weird that we focus on staying true to our word versus showing up as the best version of ourselves and actually <a href=# class=T3D>being good company</a>. Even if you promised to meet your friends for dinner, is it really worth it to go if you’re exhausted, it’s pouring rain, or you’re doubled over with period cramps? I’d say not. At that point, you’re just going through the motions.</p><figure class="Qf5 E1M" readability=2><p>fotostorm/E+/Getty Images</p></figure><p>IMO, there’s no excuse too small to bail out at the last minute, and sometimes it’s even the more polite thing to do. Here’s why:</p><li>Almost everyone <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>feels a rush of relief</a> when a cancellation text lights up the group chat. We’re all secretly <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>hoping someone else will back out first</a>, so go ahead and be the hero we all want and deserve.</li><li>Nothing is more fun than staying in. Sure, it may be ~cooler~ to go out and take tons of pics at a party, but is it more enjoyable than watching movies with your dog? No.</li><li>Canceling <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>saves time and energy</a>. Think of all the effort you and your friends would have to expend by schlepping to a venue. Backing out means you get to scrap it all and relax.</li><li>It saves money. No <a href=# class=T3D>girl math</a> required.</li><li>Making plans always seems like a great idea in the moment, but when the day arrives it only ever feels like a hassle. We’re all <a href=# class=T3D>in our bed rot era</a>, after all.</li><li>You can always reschedule.</li><li>Sometimes you just aren’t feeling social, and that’s OK. Your real friends will understand.</li><p>The only time I can see pushing through is if you’re the <a href=# class=T3D>maid of honor at a wedding</a> or if it’s somebody’s birthday. If you have a major obligation or people are relying on you and you alone, then you should probably grit your teeth and stick to the plan. (Or, at the very least, cancel with a little more notice.)</p>The jeans come off, the hair goes up, and I get to mercifully fall back onto my couch — where I wanted to be all along.<p>As a major <a href=# class=T3D>people pleaser</a>, it’s taken me forever to get to the point where I’m OK with canceling plans. If you don’t want to go out, I certainly don’t want to make you, so this goes both ways. In fact, I think it’s amazing when people admit that they’d rather stay home. My friend group loves to cancel on each other, and we’ve all bonded over it.</p><p>I also knew I was onto something when my TikTok algorithm figured out that I’m a fan of canceling. Turns out there’s a whole community of introverts online that expound on the <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>virtues of canceling plans so you can stay in</a>. If you find yourself waffling or wavering — or maybe even gently sobbing — as you get ready to go out, I truly believe you should do everyone a favor and cancel.</p><p>Get Even More From Bustle — Sign Up For The Newsletter</p><p>From hair trends to relationship advice, our daily newsletter has everything you need to sound like a person who’s on TikTok, even if you aren’t.</p><p>More like this</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o8HSraOeZpOkunC4yJ%2BcaJuRo7CmuMinnmaonJa7tHnArWSlmaOpeq61za6rng%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
