I wanted to say I am sorry and, you know me, I’d never do this to any of you, you’re my family. I swear to God, I didn’t do this.’</p><p>Tyler Perry took to social media to discuss the situation, saying: ‘I have spoken to Jussie, and he’s adamant he’s telling the truth. Also, everyone I know who knows him says he is not the kind of person who would make up such an awful thing. Yet the evidence seems to say otherwise. I am lost for words. To stoke fears and raise racial tensions is just wrong in every situation! Yet my prayers are still with him, his family and our Nation.’</p><p>The actor and director concluded his statement by asking people to ‘stop the hate!’</p><p>Rapper and actor O’Shea Jackson, who is Ice Cube’s son, also talked about it on a post!</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>What upsets me about this Jussie situation is that people were genuinely worried about you man.
