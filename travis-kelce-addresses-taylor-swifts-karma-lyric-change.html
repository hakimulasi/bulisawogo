“I went down to Argentina and it was a whole bunch of fun,” Travis, 34, told Jason Kelce on the Wednesday, November 15, episode of their “New Heights” podcast. “I went south of the equator, which I’ve never been [to] ever in my life.”
Travis touched down in Buenos Aires, Argentina, on Friday, November 10, one day after Swift, 33, kicked off her international run of Eras shows."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

She <a href=#>canceled her Friday concert</a> due to excessive rain — Travis joked on the podcast that “lightning and electronics don’t mesh very well,” referring to Swift’s stage setup — but Travis was <a href=#>spotted shaking it off in the audience</a> when Swift took the stage on Saturday, November 11. He joined Swift’s dad, who was wearing a Kansas City Chiefs lanyard, in the VIP tent.</p><p>Swift acknowledged Travis in the crowd a handful of times throughout the three-hour show, but her lyric change in “Karma” drew the biggest reaction. While closing out her set, Swift sent fans into a frenzy by singing <a href=#>“Karma is the guy on the Chiefs”</a> instead of “Karma is the guy on the screen.” Footage shared via social media showed Travis blushing at the sweet shout-out.</p><p>When Jason, 36, brought up the now-viral moment, Travis initially said he “had no clue” what Swift was planning. “Well, I might have had a little bit of a clue,” he continued. “But definitely, when I heard it come out of her mouth, it still shocked me. I was like, ‘Oh … she really just said that.'”</p><p>Jason joked that his brother was “so shocked” that he failed to give Swift’s dad a high-five. “Mr. Swift, I apologize, big guy,” Travis said. “I never miss a high-five too, big high-five guy. It’s the most electric thing you could do at an event.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Travis-Kelce-Blown-Away-by-Taylor-Swift-Concert-in-Argentina-Karma-Lyric-Change-2.jpg><p>Travis was seen interacting with Scott at other points during the concert — and <a href=#>had very different reactions</a> when Swift was performing her steamy “Vigilante S–t” choreography. She and Travis, who have been linked since September, were later spotted kissing backstage after the show.</p><p>“I was blown away. … The show was even more electric knowing that I had a little bit more to enjoy [it] for,” Travis gushed on Wednesday. “Taylor absolutely ripped it. She killed it. It looked like she was having some fun up there.”</p><p>He went on to tell Jason, “We gotta get you to a concert. … I’m telling you, it’ll blow you away.”</p><p>Travis previously saw The Eras Tour in July at his NFL team’s home turf, Arrowhead Stadium, in Kansas City. He revealed on “New Heights” after the show that <a href=#>he tried to exchange numbers with Swift</a> but wasn’t able to meet her at the time. She later attended one of <a href=#>his football games</a> in September — and the pair’s romance has been heating up ever since.</p><p>While Swift has been more tight-lipped about the budding relationship, Travis hasn’t shied away from publicly discussing his love life. When the twosome stepped out for multiple date nights in New York City last month — and made surprise cameos on the season 49 premiere of Saturday Night Live — Travis recapped the weekend on his and Jason’s podcast.</p><p>“We showed up at SNL with the idea of supporting Ice Spice, her and Taylor are friends. I’ve always wanted to meet [host] Pete Davidson, been a fan of his for quite a while … It was electric to be back in that place,” Travis said on the October 14 episode. “There is just something about being in that room.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>A source exclusively told Us Weekly at the time that Swift was “falling for [Travis] more and more as the days go by,” adding that Travis “goes out of his way to make Taylor feel special in any way he can.”</p><p>Their relationship <a href=#>has only gotten stronger</a> — and they’ve put thought into how to make long-distance dating work while Swift is on tour. “Travis and Taylor are a very real couple, they actually spend a lot of one-on-one time together and have developed a very real connection,” a second insider told Us earlier this month. “They have very detailed plans coming up on how to stay together while she’s on tour and he has games.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGatqpGrtrR5yp6jnJ1dlrGlvsSsqp6rXamuurjOq2Ssr5mbwbR5ypqpppldocaztcJmmqGZnpyycA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
