In 1983, the late actor, whose real name was Harry Bratsburg, told the Chicago Tribune (via <a href=#>Me TV</a>): "I wish I hadn't changed my name, to tell you the truth, I like my name. It sounds like I look." He went on to praise actor John Hodiak, who refused to change his name. "I always admired John Hodiak," Morgan said. "They wanted him to change his name, and he said, no, that's my name. And he was proud of being Ukrainian."</p><p dir=ltr>As for Harry Morgan's background, the star was born to parents who immigrated to the United States from Europe, per <a href=#>IMDb</a>. His father, Henry Bratsberg, was originally from Norway. The actor's mother, Anna Olsen, was born in Sweden. Bratsberg worked as a mechanic while Olsen took care of the home. If given the opportunity, it seems that Morgan would have embraced his family's last name, because he told the Chicago Tribune: "I'm all in favor of remembering one's roots. Well, that's what this country was all about!"</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmbXBlZn93e8Keo56aop7BqrHSZq6hp12nsqi%2BxK1kraCVnr9uv9Oanp5lnpa6pr%2BO</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
