Aaliyah told&nbsp;The Chicago Sun-Times,&nbsp;"I don't really comment on that because I know that's not true," and explained, "When people ask me, I tell them, 'Hey, don't believe all that mess. We're close and people took it the wrong way.'"&nbsp;</p><p>For his part, when asked about the relationship, Kelly told&nbsp;GQ&nbsp;in its 2016 profile, "I will never have that conversation with anyone. Out of respect for Aaliyah, and her mother and father who has asked me not to personally. But I can tell you I loved her, I can tell you she loved me, we was very close. We were, you know, best best best best friends."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamhoaIB3e9Snq6iklGLBs8HToWSamZyexqK0jg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
