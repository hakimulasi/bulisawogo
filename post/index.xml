And way down south in Mexico
They're singing feliz Navidad

Where the white lights glow
They're dancing in the snowAnd the bells, the bells, the bells

The joy, the joy, the joy
They're bringing
For every boy and girl
It's Christmas time, all over the world</description></item><item><title>Amber Scholl Net Worth 2024: Age, Height, Weight, Boyfriend, Dating, Kids, Bio-Wiki</title><link>/amber-scholl-net-worth-2020-2021.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 13 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/amber-scholl-net-worth-2020-2021.html</guid><description>Celebrated Name: Amber Scholl Real Name/Full Name: Amber Scholl Gender: Female Age: 30 years old Birth Date: August 13, 1993 Birth Place: Los Angeles, California, United States Nationality: American Height: 1.60 m Weight: 55 kg Sexual Orientation: Straight Marital Status: Single Husband/Spouse (Name): N/A Children/Kids (Son and Daughter): No Dating/Boyfriend (Name): N/A Is Amber Scholl Lesbian?</description></item><item><title>Barbara Stanwyck's Tragedy-Filled Life and Rocky Path to Hollywood Fame</title><link>/253878-barbara-stanwycks-tragedy-filled-life-ro-html.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 13 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/253878-barbara-stanwycks-tragedy-filled-life-ro-html.html</guid><description>Barbara Stanwyck, a famous actress from the 40s, had a tragedy-filled life and a rocky path to Hollywood fame.
