He is best known for claiming to have had a six-year sexual affair with <a href=# title="John Travolta Net Worth">John Travolta</a> in the 1980s while he was acting as a personal pilot for the actor. Gotterba worked for an aviation company Alto from 1981 until 1987, when he and the company ended the business relationship via a written termination agreement. In the wake of a series of 2012 gay scandals regarding Travolta's interactions with male masseuses, Gotterba said he was "unwillingly thrust" into the limelight by others, at which point he decided to "tell the story of his life and those involved in it." Gotterba's ex-boyfriend Robert Britz, who the pilot dated after his time with Travolta, also dished details of Gotterba's Travolta-related revelations to The National ENQUIRER.</p><p>After Gotterba himself gave an interview to The National ENQUIRER, he started putting together a book, at which point he received cease-and-desist letters from Travolta's&nbsp;powerhouse lawyer, Marty Singer, admonishing the pilot and saying he was in violation of the confidentiality provision in the 1987 pact he signed in his severance with the aviation company, Alto. After Gotterba and his attorney reviewed&nbsp;the 1987 pact Gotterba&nbsp;claimed the documents were "not authentic" - but part of an unrelated contact that was irrelevant to Travolta's&nbsp;claims. At that point, Gotterba sued both Travolta and the company to gain clarification as to which agreement was in proper legal standing; Alto countered with an anti-SLAPP motion. In July of 2014, the court allowed the confidentiality suit from Gotterba to move forward because it is relevant to "the validity of the asserted termination agreements."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue9GimqGdo6l6pLHLnpmroaSesrR7w6isoKSRqHqou9OtnKuakWK7psCMsKarrJhk</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
