And, to really drive the point home, having Nick Jonas clad in a suit on her arm is the perfect finishing touch for a couples moment fit for the history books.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The latest stop on Chopra's world tour was London, England, where she's promoting her new Prime Video series, Citadel, which also stars Game of Thrones's Richard Madden. After stops in Asia, the cast touched down in Londontown, where Chopra wore the floor-sweeping red gown and posed with her husband. Together, they very much recalled Vivian Ward and Edward Lewis from <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>1990's&nbsp;Pretty Woman</a>. Chopra didn't add a necklace, but her corseted red gown looked like it pulled one or two references from the classic scene where Vivian and Edward head to the opera together. Chopra finished her look with a fluffy blowout and no jewelry at all, letting the structure and silhouette of the body-skimming dress shine.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">During a recent interview with&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Access Hollywood</a>, Chopra spoke about wanting to make her daughter, Malti Marie, proud. With&nbsp;Citadel&nbsp;already renewed for a second season and the rom-com&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Love Again</a>&nbsp;on the way (not to mention Quantico), we think there'll be plenty for the little one to watch when she's old enough.<br></p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I hope that her relationship with me will be outside of her job. I hope when she sees the trajectory of the choices that I've made over time, that she's proud of my choices. I think I would really like her to like me. Just be like 'Oh, I love hanging out with my mom,' because I was like that until I became a teenager," she said before mentioning that Malti (for the time being) loves spending time with her mother. "But until then, I loved hanging with my parents and so far she does, too."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Chopra also mentioned one more reason for Malti to look up to her mother: she's leading a spy thriller, which is something that few women ever get to do.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"When you think about the spy genre it's predominantly male-dominated to be able to have a female character that is toe-to-toe and you know is really cohesively written was really cool," Chopra said.<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57z6ugspmeoK5ur8eop6uZXZi2ta3DnqNmqKKauqqx0Z5kpaeembyvedGem2acoprAtHmWbW9raWBo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
