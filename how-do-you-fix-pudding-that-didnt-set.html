If it is but it still hasn’t thickened, you will have to <b>add more starch, either cornstarch or another alternative, to thicken it up to the right consistency</b></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=How_long_does_it_take_for_pudding_to_set></span>How long does it take for pudding to set?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Pour the pudding into a bowl and place in the fridge for <b>5 minutes. The pudding may seem thin, but will thicken as it cools. Once the 5 minutes are up, take a spoon and gingerly stick it into the pudding. If it hasn’t set, leave the pudding in the fridge a while longer.</b></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=How_do_you_fix_a_watery_homemade_pudding></span>How do you fix a watery homemade pudding?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><b>Add Some Starch</b> If the pudding is thin, you can make a slurry by dissolving cornstarch in the water. Adding the slurry to your pudding will instantly thicken it up.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Why_is_pudding_runny></span>Why is pudding runny?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Placing your spoon, which has traces of saliva on it, back into the pudding transfers small amounts of saliva into your pudding. Since these starch molecules absorbed water molecules when the pudding was made, your pudding becomes <b>watery as the starch molecules are broken down and forced to release the water molecules</b></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=How_do_you_fix_an_unset_pudding></span>How do you fix an unset pudding?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>First things first; you will want to <b>whisk your sugar, milk, and cream together and bring that to a simmer. You will need to measure out three-quarters of a teaspoon of gelatin powder for every cup of liquid in the pudding.</b></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=How_do_you_thicken_homemade_pudding></span>How do you thicken homemade pudding?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Thickening the Pudding <b>Using eggs: Eggs add richness to puddings, whether or not the recipe includes additional thickeners. To add eggs to a hot liquid, you need to temper them (see Tempering Eggs below) so they don’t end up as scrambled eggs. Rice and tapioca also act as thickeners.</b></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=How_long_does_it_take_pudding_to_set_in_the_fridge></span>How long does it take pudding to set in the fridge?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Place the bowl of pudding into the refrigerator, and let it chill for <b>AT LEAST 2 hours, or until it gets really cold! It’s easy to make this up early in the day, or at night, then chill all day OR overnight, for best results! When the pudding is fully chilled, it is ready to serve!</b></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=How_long_does_it_take_pudding_to_firm></span>How long does it take pudding to firm?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>If made correctly, instant pudding should firm up very quicklyafter <b>about five minutes. If after that timeframe your pudding still isn’t set, it could be for a variety of reasons.

The answer is yes, <b>you could use the freezer but there is a better way. Half fill a large bowl with water, ice, and a sprinkle of salt.</b></p><h2></h2><h2></h2><h2></h2><h2></h2><h2></h2><h2></h2><h2></h2><h2></h2><h2></h2><h2></h2><h2></h2><h2></h2><h2></h2><h2></h2><h2></h2><p class=dpsp-share-text>Share this</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmidkam2r7PEsaeiqpWZe6S7zGifqK9dmbxuxc6uZJ%2BhqGK9trDDoqWgZaSdrrV5w6Kbp6xdqLK1ew%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
