The Netflix movie is based on a 2005 novel and, while Sandler is a producer, it’s written by Alison Peck, and directed by Sammi Cohen — so don’t expect Sandler’s typical raunchy humor. The story follows Stacy Friedman (Sunny Sandler, Adam’s real daughter), a girl in the 7th grade who is preparing for her Bat Mitzvah, which she thinks will open social opportunities if she throws a good party."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Sure. But Sunny Sandler is good in the role, delivering a funny and genuine performance.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Adam Sandler and Idina Menzel as Stacy’s parents. <span class=credit>©Netflix/Courtesy Everett Collection</span></figure><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Sunny Sandler may be a “nepo baby,” but she also delivers a good performance. Right: Adam Sandler. <span class=credit>Courtesy of Netflix</span></figure><p>Since the movie is about a self-involved wealthy preteen who is trying to essentially throw a lavish party, it could easily come across as unrelatable.&nbsp;</p><p>But the story manages to deliver a heartfelt family movie about friendship and growing up.</p><p>It’s not as goofy or outlandish as some of Sandler’s previous works. As the family patriarch, Danny is low- key and wry (although he’s not without some wily moments, such as telling a blathering man to shut up so that Danny can enjoy his food; stealing his wife’s earrings; or inappropriately wearing a Hawaiian short to a formal event).</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Idina Menzel, Samantha Lorraine, Adam Sandler, Sunny Sandler, and Sadie Sandler. <span class=credit>©Netflix/Courtesy Everett Collection</span></figure><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Samantha Lorraine as Lydia, Stacy’s BFF with whom she gets into a fight. <span class=credit>Courtesy of Netflix</span></figure><p>The movie isn’t perfect; it’s bloated with too much throat-clearing and, while the central conflict is Stacy’s best friend kissing her crush, it takes over 20 minutes to arrive at that point.</p><p>Most of the jokes elicit an amused smile, not a laugh-out-loud guffaw.&nbsp;</p><p>For instance, when Stacy is presenting her parents with a slide show of what she wants her party to look like, there are photos of popular current musicians that she (somehow) wants as entertainment, including Beyonce, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Taylor Swift</a> and Olivia Rodrigo. There’s also a photo of Paul McCartney mixed in, for which Lydia explains, “The old guy is for your dad.”&nbsp;</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Stacy (Sunny Sandler, Adam’s daughter). <span class=credit>Courtesy of Netflix</span></figure><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Sunny Sandler, Samantha Lorraine, Sadie Sandler, Zaara Kuttemperoor, Idina Menzel, and Adam Sandler. <span class=credit>©Netflix/Courtesy Everett Collection</span></figure><p>This is a movie that feels like it understands teenagers and how their minds work — their self-involved thoughts, fights with friends that feel like the end of the world and the fact that the boy that Stacy and Lydia fight over is wildly unremarkable.&nbsp;</p><p>It’s also refreshing that the teens in this movie all look like teens (because the actors are), rather than 30 year-olds pretending to be younger.</p><p>“You Are So Not Invited To My Bat Mitzvah” doesn’t reach the heights of Sandler’s best work from early in his career, but it’s a charming enough family movie, and it announces his daughter, Sunny, as a talent — nepo baby or not.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlf3R7j3Fma21flrGiuYysmKecnJq%2FtHnNnq5mppWps62112adoqSdYravwsitnJ1lmJ7AbsPHqKOeZZaWuqq42Gapnq6ZmsRw</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
