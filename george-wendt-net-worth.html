Actor <a href=#>Jason Sudeikis</a> is his nephew. George's older sister is Jason's mother. Although he was born in Chicago, he actually attended high school in Prairie du Chien in Wisconsin.</p><p>After graduating from high school, Wendt attended the University of Notre Dame and received a 0.00 GPA during his first semester.
