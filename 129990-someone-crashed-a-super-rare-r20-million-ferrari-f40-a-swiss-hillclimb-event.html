Judging from the damage incurred, it'll take a large investment to repair the supercar.</p><p class=align-left>The F40 was produced between 1987 and 1992 and only 1 315 models came off the production line. It's powered by a twin-turbocharged 2.9-litre V8 engine that produces 352kW in European spec, according to <i><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">CarScoops</a></i>. Its engine is mounted longitudinally in the rear mid-section of the car with power going only to the rear wheels.</p><p class=align-left><strong>PAY ATTENTION: </strong><a id=https://briefly.co.za/8119-new-facebook-algorithm-how-briefly-news-news-feed-now.html#8119 href=#>Click</a> “See First” under the “Following” tab to see Briefly News on your News Feed!</p><p></p><p class=align-left><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Cars and Planes of Switzerland</a> posted the clip on their YouTube page.

The car looks badly damaged tho [sic]."<p class=align-left>The crash likely occurred after the driver applied too much throttle on corner entry and the F40's turbos boosted with a large amount of power, making the rear-wheel-drive-only car difficult to control.</p><p class=align-left>A video of the crash was posted by <strong><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Carsten Carsten</a></strong>.</p><p></p><h3>Ferrari's incredible Goodwood of Festival of Speed display showcases 27 of the greatest Italian supercars</h3><p class=align-left>The Ferraris on display at Goodwood this weekend thankfully won't be damaged,<strong> Briefly News </strong>reports.</p><p class=align-left>It's an important year for the Italian supercar brand Ferrari.
