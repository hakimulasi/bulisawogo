It turns out, the reality star and the Hollywood A-lister both received treatment from the same doctor this year. As Montag revealed to <a href=#><strong>Us Weekly</strong></a> in its Nov. 18 issue, she recently removed her F-cup breast implants. Her doctor? <strong>Dr. </strong><strong>Jay Orringer</strong>, who just so happens to be the same surgeon who helped Jolie with her breast reconstruction surgery after <a href=#>her mastectomy.</a></p><p>In 2010, <a href=#>the former Hills star went under the knife</a> to get size-F breast implants, along with nine other procedures. But as she now tells <strong>Us</strong>, the surgery caused several health problems.</p><p>"I couldn't conceptualize the weight of them in my body," the 27-year-old MTV alum told <strong>Us</strong> of her old implants. "They felt like bowling balls on my chest." Indeed, Montag decided this time around to downsize to a C-cup to help stop the back and neck problems and numbness in her arms that she previously was feeling.</p><p>As for Jolie, the Maleficent actress <a href=#>first opened up about her reconstructive surgery</a> done by Dr. Orringer in a revealing New York Times Op-ed piece in May. The 38-year-old star underwent <a href=#>a preventive double mastectomy</a> to remove both breasts and reduce her risk of cancer in February.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>"I can tell my children that they don't need to fear they will lose me to breast cancer," she wrote of her six kids with fiance <a href=#><strong>Brad Pitt</strong></a> at the time. "It is reassuring that they see nothing that makes them uncomfortable. They can see my small scars and that's it. Everything else is just Mommy, the same as she always was."</p><p>She continued: "I feel empowered that I made a strong choice that in no way diminishes my femininity." Since then, the Salt 2 star has been looking happy and healthy. <a href=#>She's currently in Sydney, Australia</a> making her directing debut in the WWII film Unbroken.</p><p>For more on Heidi Montag's recent surgery — including how Spencer helped her recover, and why she got the implants to begin with — pick up the new issue of <strong>Us Weekly</strong>, on stands now.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZJunlK58r7HWrGahnZmZtm65zqermp9dlruoscuipZplmqS5qrGMrqqenF2orq6xjKmjmquknrBuv9Srnp6nnmKzsL6Mm6memaOperOxw66araGfo3qzscKopaysoqqwtbXOp2RraGFohXJ9jg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
