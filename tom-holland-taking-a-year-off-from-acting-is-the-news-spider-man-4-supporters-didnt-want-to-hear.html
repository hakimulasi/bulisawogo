Nevertheless, the news of his hiatus dashed the hopes of disgruntled Marvel fans who want the next installment of the&nbsp;Spider-Man&nbsp;franchise to happen sooner rather than later.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=287 data-current-count=610 data-injectable=true>Seething over the inevitable delay caused by his sabbatical, they criticized Holland’s other film ventures. One fan posted the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">dismal Rotten Tomatoes rating for&nbsp;The Crowded Room</a>&nbsp;and suggested that its critical failure is the real reason the actor is taking a break.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>Dude just cant escape the web to save himself from Spiderman! 😭 <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/t3s91ieEhL</a></p>— 🅳🅴🅽🅽🅸🆂 (@dennis_k_g) <a href=#>June 7, 2023</a></figure><p data-characters=147 data-current-count=447 data-injectable=true>Many fans believed that the British actor needed some well-deserved rest and relaxation, considering the lackluster performance of his other films.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>I would too if all my roles outside Spiderman were critical and financial bombs.

It’s likely that to some extent the strike informed his decision to take a break as screenplays are the substance of the film business, and without writers to create vehicles for film studios to produce, promote, and profit from, the entire industry grinds to a halt.</p><p data-characters=286 data-current-count=286 data-injectable=false>While fans roast Holland on social media, it’s worth noting that at only 27, his films have grossed over $10 billion. Whether his hiatus is due to his ambigous support of the WGA, the poor performance of&nbsp;The Crowded Room,&nbsp;or other reasons, it is undeniably well-deserved</p><p data-characters=132 data-current-count=418 data-injectable=false>In the meantime, at least we can rewatch many of his outings as Spider-Man — <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">including Spider-Man: Homecoming</a> — on Disney Plus.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJoq6ilXZ28rbjAp5tmrJGgtq%2BzjJpksp2Rp3qwssVmnaunnWKupMDIp55moaNiwamxjKecsKtdqL2qsMSrZKaZnmKBbr%2FUqaeoqqSav7R5w6Kbp6xdrK6vwIytpmaglZa%2FcA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
