Being the co-host of one of the highest rated radio shows in America has helped Griswold to increase his net worth.</p><p>Have you ever wondered how rich Tom Griswold is, as of mid-2016? According to authoritative sources, it has been estimated that Tom’s net worth is as high as $15 million, with an annual salary of $4 million. He has been working on the radio for more than 30 years, and having a successful show has certainly improved his wealth.</p><h3>Tom Griswold Net Worth $15 Million</h3><p>Thomas Bruce Griswold was born the son of Sally Griswold and Herbert Bruce, and grew up in Ohio where he went to University School in Hunting Valley, after which he graduated with a BA degree in Literature from Colombia University.</p><p>Early in his career, Griswold started in WET in DeLand, Florida and then with WMBN and WJML in Petoskey, Michigan where he met his friend and future colleague <a href=#>Bob Kevoian</a>. In 1983, Griswold joined WFBQ Radio in Indianapolis and is still working there. He and Bob established the radio program called “The Bob & Tom Show” in 1983, with news director Kristi Lee, sports commentator and comic foil <a href=#>Chick McGee</a>, and producer Dean Metcalf as part of the cast. These provided a strong start to his net worth.</p><p>“The Bob & Tom Show” is a comedy-variety show that airs 6–10 AM ET on weekdays and has hosted numerous famous guests including musicians, politicians, actors, authors, and professional athletes such as <a href=#>Peyton Manning</a>, <a href=#>Reggie Miller</a>, and<a href=#> Jeff Saturday</a>. The show later had its debut on television, but that lasted only two years, from 2008 to 2010 when it was cancelled. However, the radio program has remained hugely popular, and has been nationally syndicated since 1995. As a significant reward, the pair of hosts earned their induction into the National Radio Hall of Fame in September 2015.</p><p>Regarding his personal life, Tom Griswold is married to Betsy, and they are the parents of four girls and three boys. He is a brother of model Janet Griswold de Villeneuve. Griswold spent a week in the hospital after having a motorcycle accident in July 2009, suffering a shoulder injury and broken right arm and had surgery to repair his arm. Nonetheless, he came back into the show a couple of weeks later.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=14.63338658147><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Tom Griswold</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$15 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Salary</td><td>$4 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>April 22, 1953</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Cleveland, Ohio, United States</td></tr><tr readability=5><td>Profession</td><td>Film Producer, Screenwriter, Actor,Host</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Education</td><td>Columbia University, University School</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>American</td></tr><tr><td>Spouse</td><td>Betsy Griswold</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Children</td><td>Bob and Tom Radio: The Comedy Tour, Bob & Tom: Comedy All Stars Tour</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Parents</td><td>Herbert Bruce Griswold, Sally Griswold</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Siblings</td><td>Janet Griswold de Villeneuve</td></tr><tr readability=6><td>Nicknames</td><td>Dr. Tom Whiskey , Bob and Tom , Bob & Tom , Dick Mango , Thomas Bruce "Tom" Griswold</td></tr><tr readability=0.20512820512821><td>IMDB</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1132377/</a></td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Movies</td><td>Bob and Tom Radio: The Comedy Tour, Bob & Tom: Comedy All Stars Tour</td></tr></table><table class=quotes readability=4><tr><th>#</th><th>Quote</th></tr><tr readability=5><td>1</td><td>To change an old joke just a little bit, the best sound a lute makes is when a banjo lands on it in the dumpster.
