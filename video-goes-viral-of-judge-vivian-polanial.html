According to sources close to her, she has been diagnosed with depression and anxiety. These conditions have reportedly affected her ability to perform her duties at times and have led to extended periods of time spent at home under the protection of security escorts. It is believed that these mental health issues are connected to the immense pressure and stress associated with her position as a judge in Cúcuta, particularly given the threats she has received.</p><p>Indeed, another significant aspect of Judge Polanía’s personal circumstances is the threats she has received from criminal groups operating along the border with Venezuela. For the past three years, she has lived with constant fear for her safety due to these threats. This has resulted in heightened security measures being implemented, including having security escorts accompany her wherever she goes.

Her popularity on the platform has attracted sponsorship from North American companies. However, it has also raised questions about potential conflicts of interest and ethical concerns regarding how she presents herself as a public servant.</p><p>The video circulating on WhatsApp showing Judge Polanía conducting a judicial proceeding semi-nude and smoking in bed has prompted inquiries into whether she committed any disciplinary offenses. The National Commission for Judicial Discipline has requested an investigation into her alleged misconduct during this virtual hearing. Additionally, in February 2021, the Cúcuta Judicial District Superior Court issued a circular recommending that judges keep their cameras turned on during all court proceedings – a guideline that appears not to have been followed by Judge Polanía.</p><p>While Judge Polanía has remained silent regarding the recent virtual hearing incident, she posted a cryptic message on her Instagram account stating “Only God knows the cross you bear.” It is clear that her personal circumstances, including mental health struggles and threats received, have had significant impacts on both her professional and personal life. The ongoing investigations and debates surrounding her conduct contribute to a complex narrative surrounding this controversial judge.</p><p>The viral video featuring Judge Vivian Polanial on Instagram has captured the attention of many.
