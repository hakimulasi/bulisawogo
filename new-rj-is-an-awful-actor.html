 16 Likes I think he’s an okay actor, definitely better than Taylor’s recast in my opinion, but i just don’t like his character, I think he’s boring and pointless.
 3 Likes I have a big problem with characters coming in receiving full-blown praise and adulation."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Paris was like that too: she walks in to visit her sister, and the next thing you know, she’s Mother Theresa and setting up a foundation, and she also sees flaws and improvements in designs that professional fashion designer Zende can’t see.</p><p>Now, RJ is the second coming of Christ, a world famous influencer, and the heir apparent to Ridge as a designer despite having not drawn anything since he retired his crayon set. It doesn’t ingratiate these characters to us. I wish they would say less about them and just let them reveal their character by their deeds. Why do we have to have them spelled out to us it in such dull and overhyped ways?</p><p><span class=post-likes>19 Likes</span></p><p>He looks like he could pass for Ridge in another 50 years.

He looks like he is still in high school.</p><p><span class=post-likes>2 Likes</span></p><p>He needs a real storyline. If he was brought back just to narrate the current storylines what is the point? They already have characters doing that. I miss the older days of B&B when everyone had a storyline.</p><p><span class=post-likes>6 Likes</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirn5a9tHrSoZykpp%2BswG%2BvzqZmpp2jqK6osYybppqqlKh8tXvNnq5mqppitrR5wKdkmq%2BWqrlurcKtpqtnaGWGdICT</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
