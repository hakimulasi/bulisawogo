From SCHP case notes it was apparent that the SCHP did not believe Mr. Smith’s death was a hit and run by a motor vehicle, according to a press release issued by the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division (SLED) on March 22 of this year.</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener>According to CNN’s reporting</a>, new evidence discovered while looking into the k!llings of Maggie and Paul Murdaugh has prompted a reopening of the investigation.</p><p>Former South Carolina attorney Alex Murdaugh was found guilty earlier this month for the 2021 murd*rs of his son Paul and wife Maggie.
