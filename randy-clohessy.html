The ceremony took place at St. Patrick’s Cathedral in Manhattan among more than a hundred guests.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2020/4/22/Randy-and-Frankies-wedding-photos-pinterest.com_..-1587534694049.jpg><p>During their wedding, the bride was 24 years old, where the groom was 47, but the two were one of the most beautiful couples despite the age difference. Randy wore an elaborate, dazzling bridal veil on the wedding day whereas Frankie wore a double-breasted, cream-colored jacket with a lavender boutonnière.</p><p>The newly-weds couple rode away after their event was over, flashing Rolls-Royce toward the reception in Orange, New Jersey. Furthermore, they also share three sons named <strong>Francesco</strong>, now 32, and twins, <strong>Emilio </strong>and<strong> Brando</strong>, 24.</p><h2>Divorce Finalized in the Year 2004</h2><p>The couple spent 22 years in a matrimonial connection, before their divorce in 2004.

The state supreme court later ruled on the 15th of May that the policy was community land.</p><p>Then, the same year, the divorce finalized. Clohessy lives a happy, full life with her children after the split. There are no official reports of Randy being in a relationship currently as she's keeping her personal life very secret. In the same way, celebrity wife, <a href=#><strong>Marcia Harvey</strong></a> now leads a single life after getting divorced from <strong>Steve Harvey</strong>, father of<strong> </strong><a href=#><strong>Brandi Harvey</strong></a>.</p><h2>Frankie's First and Second Marriage</h2><p>In 1954, the American singer married his first wife, <strong>Mary Mandel.</strong> But Mary had already two years old daughter <strong>Celia </strong>from previous weddings.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2020/4/22/Frankie-Valli-and-Mary-Mandel-1587535213318.jpg><p>After the marriage, he adopted his step-child Celi and had two biological daughters named <strong>Toni Valli&nbsp;</strong>and<strong> Francine Valli</strong>.
