But while the competitors themselves are fun to watch, viewers also rely on the hosts to keep the show moving along, interview contestants, and reveal who's being sent home. Since 2020, supermodel <strong>Tyra Banks</strong> has graced the ballroom floor as the <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>main host</a>, joined by actor and previous winner <strong>Alfonso Ribeiro </strong>for Season 31 late last year. But Ribeiro may soon be on his own, as Banks just announced her plans to leave the show. Read on to find out why she's making her exit.</p><p><strong>READ THIS NEXT: <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>Former The View Co-Host Says Her Cardiologist Told Her to Quit the Show</a>.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/03/GettyImages-1402731128.jpg><p><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>TMZ caught up</a> with Banks outside of Whole Foods in Santa Monica, California this week, asking her about her new ice cream brand, <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer external" href=#>SMiZE & Dream</a>.</p><p>SMiZE & Dream just launched in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), but Banks told TMZ that the ice cream will be available in the U.S. this year. The supermodel added that she actually just bought potential ice cream ingredients and was on her way to do "some research and development" for the brand's U.S. expansion.</p><p>When asked how she plans to balance her busy business schedule with her DWTS duties, Banks gave a surprising response.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/03/Screenshot-2023-03-17-at-10.38.46-AM-copy.png><p>The supermodel said that she's "crazy, crazy, crazy focused on business" and determined to get SMiZE and Dream to consumers around the world.</p><p>"I feel it's time for me to really focus on my business and my entrepreneurship," Banks told TMZ. "I think it's time to graduate from the dance floor to the stock market floor."</p><p>When asked if that meant she'd be leaving DWTS,&nbsp;she responded, "I think it's time, don't you think it's time?"</p><p>Banks added that her entrepreneurial spirit is driving the change. "I really, really want to focus on my business, and you can't do that [while] hosting a show," she explained. She summed the move up by stating that she's moving "from the ballroom to boardroom."</p><p>Best Life&nbsp;reached out to DWTS for comment on Banks' departure, but has yet to hear back.</p><p><strong>RELATED: <a href=# rel=noopener>For more up-to-date information, sign up for ourdaily newsletter</a>.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/03/shutterstock_1156653550.jpg><p>Banks is well known as a TV personality: She created and judged the hit reality competition series America's Next Top Model. And she has notable hosting credits beyond that, as she also hosted the panel talk show FABLife, the competition series America's Got Talent, and her own talk show, The Tyra Banks Show.</p><p>Fans will be happy to learn that she's not abandoning the small screen altogether, but now she'll be "behind the scenes" and more involved in TV production.</p><p>"We've got a new business show coming soon, holla!" the supermodel excitedly told TMZ. "You'll see me creating things, not just hosting things. So we got some big things."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/03/shutterstock_739585330-copy.jpg><p>Earlier this week, news broke that&nbsp;professional dancer&nbsp;<strong>Mark Ballas&nbsp;</strong>is also leaving the show. Ballas has partnered with a different celebrity for the past 20 seasons, leading them to victory three times, most recently with TikTok star <strong>Charli D'Amelio </strong>on season 31.<span aria-hidden=true>ae0fcc31ae342fd3a1346ebb1f342fcb</span></p><p>Ballas announced the news at the Pearl Concert Theater at Las Vegas' Palms Casino Resort on March 12, the <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>final day</a>&nbsp;of the&nbsp;DTWS&nbsp;tour, Good Morning America&nbsp;reported.</p><p>"I've done 20 seasons now," the dancer said. "I started this journey when I was 21, 22, and honestly, being able to dance and perform for you fans… you guys are the best fans."</p><p>Ballas added that his family was in the audience for the last show, and he wanted to end by saying, "This will be the last time you see me dance in this capacity. I'm coming to a close tonight. This is going to be my last dance."</p><p>However, as with Banks, this isn't goodbye for good. "I'm not saying this is the end," Ballas told fans.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmialajBrbXFnqanpJmjsm%2BvzqZmrbGilnqjrc2kqmaklZbDqrrGZpuappOeu6h51qKroWWknbJuv9OaqaxlnprEtHs%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
