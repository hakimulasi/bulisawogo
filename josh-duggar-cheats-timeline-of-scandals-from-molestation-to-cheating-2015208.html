Eventually, as the family grew over the next 9 seasons, the hugely popular show took on its aptly titled new name, 19 Kids and Counting.</p><p><strong>May 19, 2015: Child Molestation Allegations Revealed</strong></p><p>Rumors surfaced that the eldest Duggar son had molested five girls in 2002, when he was 14 years old. According to a police report first acquired by InTouch, Josh had allegedly fondled the breasts and genitals of the females, and his 2006 interview with Oprah Winfrey was subsequently canceled after someone had called and warned Harpo productions about what he had done.</p><p>Hours after the reports circulated across the web, a contrite Josh released a statement on his family’s official website and Facebook account. “Twelve years ago, as a young teenager, I acted inexcusably for which I am extremely sorry and deeply regret. I hurt others, including my family and close friends,” the father of four said. “I confessed this to my parents who took several steps to help me address the situation. We spoke with the authorities where I confessed my wrongdoing, and my parents arranged for me and those affected by my actions to receive counseling. I understood that if I continued down this wrong road that I would end up ruining my life.”</p><p>He concluded, “I would do anything to go back to those teen years and take different actions. I sought forgiveness from those I had wronged and asked Christ to forgive me and come into my life. In my life today, I am so very thankful for God’s grace, mercy and redemption.”</p><p><strong>May 21: Josh Steps Down From His Position at the Family Research Council</strong></p><p>“Today Josh Duggar made the decision to resign his position as a result of previously unknown information becoming public concerning events that occurred during his teenage years,” <a href=# rel=noopener>Family Research Council President Tony Perkins told <strong>Us Weekly</strong></a> in a statement. “Josh believes that the situation will make it difficult for him to be effective in his current work. We believe this is the best decision for Josh and his family at this time. We will be praying for everyone involved.”</p><p><strong>May 22: TLC Pulls 19 Kids and counting From Schedule Amid Molestation Allegations</strong></p><p>TLC removed 19 Kids and Counting from its schedule after Josh’s molestation scandal broke, the network confirmed to Us Weekly on May 22, in an official statement. “Effective immediately, TLC has pulled all episodes of 19 Kids and Counting currently from the air,” the network told Us. “We are deeply saddened and troubled by this heartbreaking situation, and our thoughts and prayers are with the family and victims at this difficult time.”</p><p>While the network pulled episodes of the popular series, TLC had yet to cancel the program entirely at the time.</p><p><strong>May 22: Judge Orders All Copies of Original Report Expunged</strong></p><p>Police destroy the original copies of the classified report from 2006, after Judge <strong>Stacey Zimmerman</strong> orders all documents to be expunged.</p><p><strong>May 22-May 30: Celebrities, Family Members, Critics React to Molestation Scandal</strong></p><p>With the Duggar family in the spotlight for scandal, celebrities came forward, ripping the conservative family — who have campaigned against abortion, gay marriage, and other issues — for hypocrisy. The list of celebrities included <strong>Montel Williams, Ryan Reynolds</strong>, and<strong> Bette Midler.</strong></p><p>Meanwhile, advertisers pulled their support from the Duggar family’s reality series, including Walgreens, General Mills, Payless, and more.</p><p>Eventually, Hulu also pulls reruns of 19 Kids and Counting from its website.</p><p><strong>June 3: Jill Duggar, Jessa Duggar Confirmed Among Josh’s Molestation Victims</strong></p><p>The now-married Duggar daughters confirmed to Fox News on June 3, during Megyn Kelly’s interview, that <a href=# rel=noopener>they were among their brother’s molestation victims</a>. The shocking revelation was made after Fox News previewed Kelly’s June 5 interview with <strong>Us Weekly,</strong> featuring a snippet of the girls confirming their brother’s molestation of them when they were young girls.</p><p><strong>June 5: Jessa, Jill, Michelle, Jim Bob Appear on The Kelly File</strong></p><p>The Duggar family’s standout sisters detailed to Megyn Kelly how the family coped after Josh molested them in 2002. The interview included family patriarch recalling the exact moment that Josh confessed to his actions. “He came to us and was crying and told us what happened,” Jim Bob recalled, saying “safeguards” were implemented to prevent future instances.</p><p>Jill, meanwhile, gave a few examples of preventative measures. “Locks on the doors,” the mother of baby Israel told Kelly. “You know, everybody’s in bed. Girls in the girls’ room. Boys in the boys’ room — as a mother now I look back, and I think, you know, my parents did such an amazing job for me. Even when we went through the DHS investigation they complimented my parents on what an amazing job they did through that process.”</p><p><strong>June 9: Moving Trucks Spotted Outside of Josh’s Five-Bedroom Home in Oxon Hill, Md.</strong></p><p>Starting anew after his molestation scandal — or something like it. Moving trucks <a href=# rel=noopener>were spotted outside of Josh’s five-bedroom home</a> in Oxon Hill, Md., on June 9, four days after his parents and sisters’ interview with Kelly aired. Josh lived in the home with his wife, Anna, and their then-three kids, daughter Mackynzie, 5, and sons Michael, 3, and Marcus, 2.</p><p>Almost two months after the scandal first broke, TLC announced on July 16, that it was canceling its wildly popular series. “After thoughtful consideration, TLC and the Duggar family have decided to not move forward with 19 Kids and Counting. The show will no longer appear on the air,” the network said in an official statement, noting that “the recent attention around the Duggars has sparked a critical and important conversation about child protection.”</p><p>In addition to the show’s cancellation, TLC also announced that it was teaming up with child-protection organizations to raise awareness about the sexual abuse of children. The network announced that it would work closely with the groups, as well as the Duggar family for a one-hour documentary that would include survivors of families affected by abuse.</p><p>“TLC has been especially concerned for the victims in this situation, including the Duggar family, and it is our hope that this effort will help those in need learn where to turn for information and help,” the network concluded. “The documentary will be commercial free, and we anticipate it will air later this summer.”</p><p>Amidst the ongoing scandal, Josh and his wife welcomed their fourth child on July 19, announcing the baby’s arrival on July 19. “Announcing the arrival of Meredith Grace Duggar!” Josh tweeted, alongside a photo of him and his wife with their newborn baby. “7lbs 14 ozs, 20-1/2in — Anna and Meredith are resting & doing well!”</p><p><strong>Aug. 19: Josh’s Ashley Madison Accounts Revealed in Major Hack</strong></p><p>Hackers followed through on its promise to release the information of millions of users on the infidelity website Ashley Madison on Aug. 18. The following day, Gawker looked into the stolen data — which included email addresses and information of millions of cheating members — and found emails and credit card information linking back to Josh. The cards were used to pay for two subscriptions to the cheating website between February 2013 and May 2015, with the billing address matching the home of the family’s grandmother Mary.</p><p>The user listed interests like “one-night stands,” and “experimenting with sex toys.”</p><p>In a statement released on the Duggar family’s official website on Thursday, Aug. 20, Josh admitted to being unfaithful to his wife Anna, also the mother of his four kids.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“I have been the biggest hypocrite ever. While espousing faith and family values, I have secretly over the last several years been viewing pornography on the internet and this became a secret addiction and I became unfaithful to my wife,” he wrote in a now-edited statement. “I am so ashamed of the double life that I have been living and am grieved for the hurt, pain and disgrace my sin has caused my wife and family, and most of all Jesus and all those who profess faith in Him.”</p><p>He concluded with an apology. “I humbly ask for your forgiveness. Please pray for my precious wife Anna and our family during this time.”</p><p>“When we learned of this late last night our hearts were broken,” Jim Bob and Michelle wrote on the family’s official website. “As we continue to place our trust in God we ask for your prayers for Josh, Anna, our grandchildren, and our entire family.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaKGoq5hisbazxpqpZpuYmq61v4ytoKadnJ67pnnOn2Ssm5GjsaK40madq6edYrqwuMSsq5qsmaS7bsDOZpqhnZGptq%2BzjGtnam1iZYU%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
