Ok maybe you don't quite yet because this deal just closed, but soon a few very lucky neighbors will indeed be able to smell what Dwayne Johnson is cooking. I'm guessing it will be grilled chicken. Unless it's a cheat day. Then it will be the smell of like 35 pancakes.</p><p>Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson is the newest resident of Beverly Park. Beverly Park is the ultra-exclusive gated community high up in the hills of Beverly Hills where some mansions have recently been listed for $100+ million.</p><p>Dwayne joins fellow celebrity Beverly Park residents like <a href=# title="Eddie Murphy Net Worth">Eddie Murphy</a>, <a href=# title="Mark Wahlberg Net Worth">Mark Wahlberg</a>, <a href=# title="Sylvester Stallone Net Worth">Sylvester Stallone</a>, <a href=# title="Rod Stewart Net Worth">Rod Stewart</a>, <a href=# title="Denzel Washington Net Worth">Denzel Washington</a> and <a href=# title="Sofia Vergara Net Worth">Sofia Vergara</a>.</p><p>With the purchase, Dwayne displaces a longtime celebrity Beverly Park resident, actor <a href=#>Paul Reiser</a>. But don't feel too bad for Paul. He's getting <strong>$27.8 million,&nbsp;</strong>which is a significant profit over the $6 million Paul paid for the home back in 1998.</p><p>Fun fact – Paul also displaced a celebrity Beverly Park resident when he bought the home in 1998. Paul bought the home from <a href=#>Alex Van Halen</a>, who actually built the property from scratch in 1993. In retrospect, that was a bad move for Mr. Van Halen. Soon after selling the home, he bought a mansion in Hidden Hills for $2 million. Today his Hidden Hills home is worth, at most, around $5 million.</p><p>He should have held onto Beverly Park!</p><p>The Rock's new estate spans 3.6 flat acres. That's significant because a bunch of Beverly Park mansions boast 3-4 acres of property, but a lot of the land is actually steep unusable hillside.</p><p>The main house is 15,000 square feet. The guest house is 2,500 square feet. The estate features a tennis court, elevator, movie theater, indoor swimming pool, outdoor swimming pool, a "world-class gym" fit for The Rock, and get this…</p><p>A baseball diamond!</p><p>Here's a video of the home from when it was listed back in 2018. You can see the baseball diamond at the 1:20 mark:</p><p></p><p>Outside of California, The Rock owns a 46-acre equestrian estate in Powder Springs, Georgia. He bought this estate in November 2019 for $9.5 million. For some reason Dwayne listed this property for sale just 14 months after the purchase, for $7.5 million, a potential $2 million loss. He hasn't found a buyer yet.</p><p>It's unclear where Paul Reiser is off to next, though he is still the owner of record of a condo in Beverly Hills which was purchased in 2007 for $755,000. Talk about downsizing! Though, I'm sure he'll buy something new within the next year to chop down some of that roughly $23 million taxable gain.</p><p>FYI, the monthly Beverly Park HOA fee is $3,300. Also, Dwayne's annual property tax bill will be around $300,000.</p><p>Thankfully, <a href=#>with a net worth of $400 million</a> and annual income typically in the $50-100 million range, I think The Rock can swing it.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue8Crq6KbnJrAcK%2FEpZybqpmpxm60zqacrGeknbJuvs6comaipajBbrzAoptmamhiuqq4y6Kmp2WWpL9uvMCuo2aqlZ7Apr7SZpmerpWnubp5z5qppGWdlru0tc6nZg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
