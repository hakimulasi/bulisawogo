The Maverick entered the ring not on his feet but on a zipline that carried him all the way from the long walkway to the squared cirlce.</p><p>This isn’t the first time WWE used ziplining to transport their superstars to the ring for their big matches. Shawn Michaels had a similar entrance for his Iron Man match against Bret Hart at WrestleMania XII. WWE used the same entrance for Owen Hart at Over the Edge 1999. Unfortunately, Hart fell to his death while he was making his entrance.</p><p>It seems that some fans were less than thrilled to witness Logan Paul’s entrance at WrestleMania 39, with a couple of users dragging the company for still resorting to zipline after the Owen Hart incident.</p><p>A fan said it was a poor choice on WWE’s part to use the zipline for The Maverick’s entrance, noting that the company didn’t learn their lesson from the tragedy at Over the Edge 1999.</p><p>Do you think WWE should’ve used a different entrance for Logan Paul? How would you rate The Maverick’s entrance at WrestleMania 39?
