“He loves to sing, and he has such a giving, loving heart about him,” the American Idol alum, 37, told Entertainment Tonight on Wednesday, October 28. “I could just hear his voice [in the song].”
The Oklahoma native, who also shares Jacob, 21 months, with her husband, Mike Fisher, added that their eldest son gave the “Little Drummer Boy” performance “his all."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

He’s throwing his hands in the air and [was] just so expressive when he was singing it. I was so proud of him, just for giving it his all and the love in his heart because he does love Jesus. At 5 years old, he knows, and he was giving all the love. I’m very proud of him.”</p><p>While the little one was “so happy” with the finished song, the Grammy winner noted that Isaiah was critiquing his work.</p><p>“I was trying to read his face,” the “Before He Cheats” crooner said. “I felt like he was like, ‘Oh, I don’t know.’ Not like, ‘I could’ve done better,’ but there was something. I’m like, ‘That is me in you for sure.’”</p><p>If Isaiah chooses to follow in his mom’s musical footsteps in the future, Underwood will “definitely be supportive.”</p><p>As for Jacob, the singer’s youngest child is a “critic,” she joked in June 2019. Underwood posted an Instagram video of her baby boy crying every time Fisher, 40, tried singing <strong>Vince Gill</strong>’s “I Still Believe in You.” Jacob only stopped when his mom chimed in, crooning the same song.</p><p><a href=#><strong>Justin Timberlake</strong></a> called the footage “the greatest thing” he’d seen all year, while country singer <strong>Lori McKenna</strong> wrote, “Oh my GOD. I’ve watched this 1000 times.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The professional ice hockey player defended his performance, writing, “He was hungry and wanted your food.”</p><p>He and Underwood <a href=#>tied the knot in July 2010</a> in Georgia.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGacmaKntqZ51KebnqqnpLylec%2BrmKKrlah6tLvNZqCsmZmWtbR5wqGpoqukoq60ecClma6lXaWys7LOq6SappOafA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
