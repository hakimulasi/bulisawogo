With people commuting to the office and having plans after their workday, acquiring an option to do it all — and do it all comfortably, might we add — is essential. Do you need a cushioned pair of functional shoes that can work for both formal and informal moments? We found a pair of cute <a href=# rel=noopener>loafers</a> that will take the pressure off your feet — and they’re 23% off right now at Zappos!</p><p>There are plenty of reasons you should opt for these <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Easy Spirit Kinndle Loafers</a>, including the fact that they’re supportive and will mesh well with pieces you already own. This pair of shoes has a suede and leather upper and a breathable, soft-touch textile with a removable memory foam footbed. Also, these shoes come engineered with -eFlex ultimate technology — along with heel cushion pillow pods — that are both orthotic-friendly and offer strong arch support, making them a suitable option for those suffering from plantar fasciitis and sciatica.</p><figure class=wp-caption></figure><p><strong>Get the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Easy Spirit Kinndle Loafers</a> for $99 (was $129) at Zappos!</strong></p><p>These sophisticated-looking loafers are a fabulously versatile option to add to your wardrobe. Due to the upscale appearance of the shoes, they fit well with jeans and sweaters for a look that works during business hours and beyond. You can also wear them with a flouncy skirt and a decadent blouse for an elevated ensemble. Additionally, these loafers come in four colors and have a 6 to 11 size range!</p><p>While reviewing and gushing over this pair of loafers, one Zappos shopper said, “These are the nicest loafers I have found. The hardware is gold in color, by the way — I thought it was silver from the photos. Anyway, I had these in the brown color (also gorgeous), but I wanted black. I found these to be the best in-between being too rock-n-roll lug sole and too flat. I think these go with everything, look like a million bucks, and are COMFORTABLE.”</p><p>Another satisfied Zappos reviewer added, “These are beautiful! I tried them on, and they fit perfectly! That rarely happens.”</p><p>With spring just around the corner, keeping a sturdy and comfy pair of <a href=# rel=noopener>loafers</a> is a wise decision.
