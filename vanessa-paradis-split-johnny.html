Though if she was feeling the strain she wasn't showing it, smiling seductively on the red carpet. The 39-year-old recently told a radio interviewer that she is used to being the centre of rumours and gossip, and doesn't feel the need to discuss her private life. "You know, if I eat three peas, I'm pregnant. If I visit a city, I'm going to buy a house there. In the winter I split up, in the summer I get married. For the last 15 years they've been saying I've got married," said the actress. "If on top of that I have to respond to all the rumours…"Vanessa and her partner of 14 years, Johnny are said to be living <a class=hm-link href=#>separate lives</a>. She is apparently based in Los Angeles where Lily, 11, and Jack, nine, attend private school, while their father travels the world for his movies. The 50-year-old actor attended the <span>Golden Globes</span> alone, and Vanessa was last seen in public turning on the Paris Christmas lights with <a class=hm-link href=#>Karl Lagerfeld</a> before her premiere outing.</p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
