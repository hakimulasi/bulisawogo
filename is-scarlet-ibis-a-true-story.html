When he learns to crawl backwards, reminding Brother of a doodle-bug, brother names him Doodle. He dies in 1918, <b>just before his seventh birthday</b>, the Saturday before his first day of school.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-killed-doodle-in-the-scarlet-ibis></span>What killed Doodle in The Scarlet Ibis?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>In the end, Doodle, unable to live up to his brother’s expectations, dies from <b>exhaustion after collapsing while running after Brother in a storm</b>. Doodle dies at the end of “The Scarlet Ibis” as a result of his brother’s pride.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-is-the-point-of-the-scarlet-ibis></span>What is the point of The Scarlet Ibis?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>The story uses a symbolic connection to the scarlet ibis, a rare bird which appeared at their <b>farm</b>, to highlight Doodle’s fragile nature and the beauty he gave to the world before his tragic demise. It also hints that, like the bird, Doodle was out of place.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=why-did-doodle-cry-when-he-first-saw-old-woman-swamp></span>Why did Doodle cry when he first saw old woman swamp?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>He begs to be taken out, and whenever the narrator goes out to play, his parents tell him to bring Doodle along. The narrator pulls him in a go-cart to his favorite spot: Old Woman Swamp. Doodle is in awe of the beauty of the scenery. He is <b>so emotional that he even cries</b>, saying “It’s so pretty.”<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=is-the-scarlet-ibis-a-movie></span>Is the scarlet ibis a movie?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-is-the-irony-in-the-scarlet-ibis></span>What is the irony in the scarlet ibis?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>The irony lies not only <b>in the brother’s inexperience and impatience</b>, not to mention his unrealistic expectations, but also in the parents’ lack of concern for their child. A storm-buffeted scarlet ibis dies, and the family watches, amused at Doodie’s clumsy burial attempts, never trying to help.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=why-does-brother-make-doodle-touch-his-coffin></span>Why does brother make Doodle touch his coffin?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>First, the narrator forces Doodle to touch his coffin <b>to purposely make him frightened</b>. This event shows the cruelty of the narrator to his brother because of his disability. Secondly, the narrator was crying when the family saw Doodle walk due to the fact that he only did it for pride.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=who-is-responsible-for-doodles-death></span>Who is responsible for Doodle’s death?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Doodle dies at age six, and <b>Brother</b> is responsible for his death. The narrator is responsible, because he knew about Doodle’s undeveloped organs, and over-worked him. Brother’s only motivation to teach Doodle to run, swim, climb and walk was the fact that he was embarrassed to have a crippled sibling.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-is-ironic-about-doodles-real-name></span>What is ironic about Doodle’s real name?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>For instance, Doodle’s true name, <b>William Armstrong</b>, is ironic, as it denotes strength when Doodle is actually physically weak. There is also dramatic irony in this story. James Hurst foreshadows throughout the narrative that Doodle is doomed to die young.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=why-is-the-name-doodle-ironic></span>Why is the name Doodle ironic?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>In the article it states, “They named him William Armstrong, which is like tying a big tail on a small kite (Hurst 1). Doodle’s real name is ironic <b>because that name suggests big and strong, which he was not</b>. He was sick, weak and small. Although Doodle was small for his size, his parents and brother did not care.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-are-the-conflicts-in-the-scarlet-ibis></span>What are the conflicts in The Scarlet Ibis?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>The main conflict of “The Scarlet Ibis” by James Hurst is <b>Brother’s inability to deal with Doodle’s disabilities</b>: his concern more for himself than Doodle. When Doodle is born, Brother considers killing him because he is “not right.” He was born when I was six and was, from the outset, a disappointment.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=is-the-scarlet-ibis-a-flashback></span>Is the scarlet ibis a flashback?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>What would be considered Flashback in Scarlet Ibis? <b>The story is told entirely as a flashback</b>. Doodle died long before the story takes place, and the narrator is remembering things that happened back then.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=why-did-the-narrator-rename-his-brother-doodle></span>Why did the narrator rename his brother Doodle?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>After <b>witnessing his unique method of crawling backward</b>, the narrator gives him the nickname Doodle and says that it was the kindest thing he could do for his younger brother “because nobody expects much from someone called Doodle.”<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-was-the-one-thing-doodle-could-beat-his-brother-at></span>What was the one thing Doodle could beat his brother at?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>What was the one thing doodle could beat his brother at? The one thing that Doodle had <b>that his brother didn’t was compassion</b>. He showed so much compassion for life in this story.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-foreshadows-doodles-death></span>What foreshadows Doodle’s death?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><b>The dying bird</b> foreshadows Doodle’s death. There are many similarities between the bird and Doodle. The bird is uncoordinated and falls. … And it is beautiful even in death.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=who-is-the-protagonist-in-the-scarlet-ibis></span>Who is the protagonist in the scarlet ibis?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><b>Brother</b> is the lead protagonist of the story and also the narrator. He is not given a name but is referred to by Doodle, his brother, only as “Brother.” He is six years old when Doodle is born.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=why-does-the-narrator-try-to-smother-his-brother></span>Why does the narrator try to smother his brother?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>His thought process in this is that <b>he makes plans to eliminate his brother to rid the family of the burden of caring for him</b>. He does learn to accept Doodle somewhat, but he and the rest of the family don’t give Doodle the respect he deserves.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-does-the-word-wrenched-mean-in-the-scarlet-ibis></span>What does the word wrenched mean in the scarlet ibis?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>wrenched. <b>pulled or twisted violently</b>. <b>uniformly</b>. <b>Always the same</b>; daily; unvarying.<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DAxJyfaKCfrHq1u46iqmark5a%2FrbHTZqCboaNirm7A0a6cZqukpL%2B6ew%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
