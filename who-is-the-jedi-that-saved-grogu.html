Star Wars: Jedi Temple Challenge brought this concept to life.</p><p>The series, inspired by The Hidden Temple pitted kids against one another on a Jedi training course. Competitors were led by Master Beq and his complaint droid, AD-3 who challenged them to display their mastery of the Jedi virtues of strength, knowledge and bravery.</p><p>You can read more about Jedi Master Kelleran Beq from Ahmed Best’s portrayal of him in Star Wars: Jedi Temple Challenge. The caring Jedi Master was influenced by Best’s own boyhood love of kung fu movies namely the characters of Obi-Wan Kenobi, Yoda and the Shaolin monks.</p><h2><strong>Who is the Jedi that Saved Grogu?</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/venturejolt.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Who-is-the-Jedi-That-Saved-Grogu-1.jpg><p><strong>Kelleran Beq saves Grogu from the dangers of the Jedi temple in the fourth episode of The Mandalorian.</strong> Ahmed Best, who hosts Star Wars: Jedi Temple Challenge plays him on the show. After the other Jedi are slain by troopers, Kelleran Beq appears at the bottom of an elevator.</p><p>Despite being followed by the enemies, he manages to get Grogu on board his speeder and into the air. He lures another ship into a collision, then crashes, picks up Grogu and blasts off into hyperspace. As the wiki describes it, Kelleran Beq was a Jedi Master who oversaw the education of Padawans.</p><p>He earned the moniker “Sabered Hand” for his prowess with a lightsaber. Best remarked in a previous interview:</p><p>“I think what’s most important about the representation of someone like Kelleran Beq as far as being a person of color and the leader of this Temple kind of like the Dean of Jedi”.</p><p>It shatters the limitations of what you can achieve and opens up an entirely new set of options.</p><p><strong>Read our below posts if you want to know about the characters from other shows and series:</strong></p><p>Please tell us how you feel about our content.
