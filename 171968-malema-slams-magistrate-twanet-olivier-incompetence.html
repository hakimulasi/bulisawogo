A policeman saw my judgement even before I could hear about it."As if that is not enough, as she was reading through (the judgement) she said she forgot two pages at the back, 'Let me go and fetch them,' is that professionalism?" asked Malema.<p class=align-left>The <a href=#>EFF</a> posted a video of Malema addressing the media outside the embassy on their X account.</p><p class=align-left>Below is the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">video</a>:</p><p class=align-left>Malema said judges and magistrates are not the constitution.</p>"She must respect the constitution. I don't care about her feelings, I care about what the law and the constitution say. I have no responsibility to nurse her feelings," he said.<h2>Netizens echo Malema's sentiments on X</h2><p class=align-left>Following the post by the party on X, netizens flooded the comment section. Some are rallying behind Malema while some said he poisons <a href=#>court</a> proceedings with political questions.</p><p class=align-left>These are some of the points raised:</p><p class=align-left>@SeageMatenche made this comparison:</p>"President, take this magistrate on, this is the same as the leaking of medical records of the former president to journalists and I was surprised that even before the court had concluded, Golaam has tweeted the outcome."<p class=align-left>@Maxwell636777 wished for this:</p>"I wish there were more Malemas, people who can call a spade a spade, unshaken for as long as they're within the confines of the law."<p class=align-left>@Jmotlhamare had this to say:</p>"As if he has posed legal questions before. All he ever does is poison the process with political questions and innuendo. Rogueness is in his DNA and he won't understand because he has cheerleaders."<p class=align-left>@Hlarediahloga said:</p>"Africa is blessed to have a leader like him, every country should have at least six Malemas."<p class=align-left>@AdrianActionMan posed this question:</p>"How can he question judges when he might be in jail soon?"<p class=align-left>@tsitso09 remarked:</p>"That's a poor attitude from someone who wants to be president. Malema is just a disaster, he brings in chaos when people differ with him. That's a serious weakness."<h2>Malema's bid for case dismissal fails</h2><p class=align-left><strong>Briefly News</strong> previously reported that Malema's bid to have his<a href=#> case struck off the roll </a>got dismissed by Magistrate Twanet Olivier. His judgement came after <a href=#>AfriForum</a> laid a charge against him for allegedly discharging a semi-automatic firearm owned by his bodyguard during the EFF’s fifth birthday celebrations in East London.</p><p class=align-left>Olivier pointed out that the state had enough evidence to go ahead with the case, whereas Malema's legal team failed to provide evidence to have the case dismissed. He previously pleaded not guilty, citing Section 174 of the <a href=#>Criminal</a> Procedure Act.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop6yp7jYZ5qoZqqWfLG7y6KropujZH54fZhvb2alkaGyrq2MrKOapaNiuqKzyKyrq5mkmnq1w8CnnK1ln6G2t7XEq2SippOkurGx056lnJ1f</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
