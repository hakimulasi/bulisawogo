According to the Season 10 alum, she says the damage control goes deeper than just connecting with your new spouse on screen, it also applied to the public scrutiny friends and family members can experience as a result of the cast being on reality television.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Mindy also warned future couples that the show "never goes away." She said as the years pass, fans will still reach out and ask about her ex-husband even though she is "over her experience." She went on to share her mindset when going into the <a href=#>MAFS process</a> and said she was focused on "being awesome" in hopes that the other person would do the same. However, "Miss Optimistic" was still left begging for divorce on social media after "The Fitness Fanatic" embarrassed her on national TV. According to Mindy, dealing with haters online can be "exhausting," but she takes it in stride. She knows her future children will be able to watch her experience on the show when they get older and it's something she says all MAFS couples should consider.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZma3FmZ4Zze8yipZ2xXai1qq7Ep2ShmaNirm7DwKuloqaXYq6ju9StZJudmaO0brvNZqSaqqKesqV5wK1kn6GiqMFuv8ign61n</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
