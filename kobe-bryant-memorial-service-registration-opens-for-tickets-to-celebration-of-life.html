John, Keri and Alyssa Altobelli — who also perished in the wreck — were <a href=#>remembered at a service at Angel Stadium</a> in Anaheim, California, on Monday, February 10.</p><p>Vanessa — who also shared Natalia, 17, Bianka, 3, and Capri, 7 months, with the five-time NBA champ — first <a href=#>opened up about her grief</a> on Instagram on January 29. “There aren’t enough words to describe our pain right now. I take comfort in knowing that Kobe and Gigi both knew that they were so deeply loved,” she wrote at the time. “We were so incredibly blessed to have them in our lives. I wish they were here with us forever. They were our beautiful blessings taken from us too soon. I’m not sure what our lives hold beyond today, and it’s impossible to imagine life without them. But we wake up each day, trying to keep pushing because Kobe, and our baby girl, Gigi, are shining on us to light the way. Our love for them is endless — and that’s to say, immeasurable.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGakp5KaeqO%2B2JqlrWWdmrqwvsiao2arlafDqq%2FEZqmen5mowbOt06Kmp2WfpbKvv4yfpqtlpJ6wrLHTrGStp12Ysq2xwauYraGfo3qwsoyloJ%2BdXw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
