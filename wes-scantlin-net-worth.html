A couple of years later, in 2004, while playing a show in Ohio, Scantlin admitted to the audience he would be unable to continue playing as he was too intoxicated. Scantlin's relationship with drugs and alcohol led to many issues within the band during their time together.</p><p>In 2012, Scantlin was arrested for cocaine possession, driving under the influence and driving without a license in California. He could have served five years in jail but agreed to complete a rehabilitation program in order to erase his potential sentence.

He was arrested also at the Milwaukee Mitchell International Airport for disorderly conduct and then was involved in a high-speed chase in Minnesota in July. He was charged with fleeing a police officer in a motor vehicle, a felony. The charges were ultimately dropped.</p><p>In early 2016, Scantlin tried to re-enter the house he had lost via a foreclosure process the previous year. He was arrested for destroying property inside the residence. In August of that year, he was arrested for attaching a fake explosive device to his vehicles in an effort to deter theft.
