Conventionally attractive actors rule marquees, aging is almost like a sin, and Hollywood wouldn't dare cast a woman with wrinkles. Time after time, <a href=#>Taylor Swift</a> has spoken out about the immense pressures women experience in the industry and elsewhere to look younger than they are, especially when men are rarely judged on their appearances.&nbsp;</p><p>After turning 30, she shared with <a href=#>Elle</a>, "I've learned that society is constantly sending very loud messages to women that exhibiting the physical signs of aging is the worst thing that can happen to us." Calling it "an impossible standard," she noted that women are made to feel as though they "aren't allowed to age." Even though, you know, aging is a totally natural part of being a human being.</p><p>Speaking with <a href=#>Time</a> magazine, the "I Knew You Were Trouble" songstress also took a swipe at those who have pitted women who are "killing it" against each other. As she put it, other successful women should "challenge you and inspire you rather than threaten you and make you feel like you're immediately being compared to them." If anyone knows a thing or two about girls sticking together it's Swift.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmb2hkZYB3e9OipJ6rXamuurjOq2Ssr5mbwW6%2Fx66rZpyfrLturYysnLGho6l6pLvMppynrF8%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
