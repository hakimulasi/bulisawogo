For those who may not know, they/them are pronouns typically ascribed to those who are non-binary and thus don’t conform to the gender binary. Overall, Uzi is not the first artist to make this change, however, they are certainly the most prevalent in hip-hop. The genre is very male-dominated, and also fairly heteronormative. Consequently, many were quick to make fun of Uzi for his pronoun change. Although, their true fans remained supportive.&nbsp;</p><p>According to XXL, Lil Uzi Vert recently graced the cover of 032c Magazine. During their appearance, they spoke about changing their pronouns and what it meant to them. Overall, it was not that hard of a decision for the hitmaker. Instead, it was something that they were thinking deeply about. Before making the change, they wanted to make sure they were doing the right thing. However, after some self-reflection, they made the change knowing it was what was best for them and their identity.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Read More: </strong><a href=# rel><strong>Lil Uzi Vert Producer Responds To Impatient Fans Asking About “Pink Tape”</strong></a></p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-lil-uzi-vert-stands-by-their-decision>Lil Uzi Vert Stands By Their Decision</h2></span><p>Rapper Lil Uzi Vert performs onstage during day 3 of Rolling Loud Los Angeles at Hollywood Park Grounds on March 05, 2023 in Inglewood, California.

Taking the time to figure out who you are is a big part of what it means to be alive. Once you figure out whether you’re here with it, there with it, or both, you’re not alone anymore. This community offers access to a certain kind of support that you might not have had [previously during] your entire life because you weren’t raised that way. I come from a household where it’s not okay to be ‘non’ anything.”</p><p>Recently, Lil Uzi Vert also spoke about <a href=# rel>going to rehab at the behest of Roc Nation</a>. Overall, it was a great decision that now has them sober and feeling great. Hopefully, this means The Pink Tape is finally on the horizon.
