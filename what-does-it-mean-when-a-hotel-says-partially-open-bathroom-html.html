The remaining two rooms were equipped with standard bathrooms (very tiny though, but clean and normal). Perhaps the half open sign indicates that the sink where you wash your hands is not located inside the restroom. You may want to double-check with the hotel to make sure that’s what they mean; you can contact them and ask them; they were quite accommodating.
