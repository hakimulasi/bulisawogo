The show came at a particularly interesting juncture for the company; a portion of fans have felt ostracized from the promotion due to some questionable booking and stagnant storylines.

One of the standout bouts was the Texas Death Match between two of AEW's biggest stars, Jon Moxley and Hangman Page. AEW World Champion MJF and Bryan Danielson closed the show with a one-hour Iron Man Match.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=mjf-s-reign-of-terror-continues>MJF's Reign Of Terror Continues</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/aew-revolution-2023-mjf-vs-bryan-danielson-iron-man-match-aew-world-championship-1.png><p>Bryan Danielson scored the first fall of the match. However, MJF then evened the score through nefarious, if not creative means; he hit Bryan Danielson with a low blow and cost himself one fall, but was able to earn two pin falls over Bryan Danielson as a result.</p><p>The action soon carried out of the ring; at one point, MJF hit a flying elbow drop on Bryan Danielson through the ring announce table. Both men's faces were covered in blood by the time the 50-minute mark came around.</p><p>The match "ended" in a draw with both men at 3 falls apiece. However, Tony Schiavone made his way to the ring to announce that Tony Khan ordered the match to continue under sudden death rules, meaning that the next competitor to score a fall would be the winner.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>MJF pulled out the win through underhanded tactics, including whacking Bryan Danielson in the head with an oxygen tank.</p><p>Something else to note was the absence of former AEW World Champion CM Punk. Rumors have been swirling regarding CM Punk's potential return to AEW television, and many fans speculated that tonight would be the night. MJF added fuel to the fire by repeatedly referring to himself as "the best in the world" during the match tonight. However, the show closed without any appearance from CM Punk.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKeoqqSowaa%2BjZympmedn7Nuu9Sto5qrpKh6o77YmqVmnJGjtqa40qilZqqVqa6qutJmmJ6vXay8s7jDZpqhmZ2ltrC60qGgqWWRqXqzsdWoo66smaS7cA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
