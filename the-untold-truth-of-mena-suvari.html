In 2012, she modeled for famed designer Christian Siriano's spring campaign (via&nbsp;<a href=#>InStyle</a>), but her love of fashion also developed into other creative outlets that were more hands-on, too.&nbsp;</p><p>For instance, in 2019, Mena Suvari released her ECHO scarf line at Bloomingdales in New York, telling&nbsp;<a href=#>People</a> that she'd "always been into fashion and [she] wanted to design something to give to charity," as the proceeds went towards the National Resources Defense Council. As a lover of the environment, she wanted to take inspiration from nature in her designs as well, telling the outlet, "When I was working in Vancouver the cherry trees bloomed, and I sent my photos and designs in from there."</p><p>In the summer of 2018, Suvari took to her <a href=#>Instagram</a> to show her "spark of creativity" with some handmade bracelets she was fashioning on her wrists. In this post, she even talked about how "many moons ago, [she] made jewelry under a label called Papillon," which sold in some boutiques in Los Angeles. So, let's add designer to the list of Suvari's talents too!&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmbHFjaX55e9OhnGatnqm8rbCMramurJhivKd5zJ6lmmWjqsOivsho</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
