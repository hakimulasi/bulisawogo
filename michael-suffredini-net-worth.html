This is the first all-private astronaut mission and is manned with four individuals paying a reported <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$55 million each</a> to fly to space—Larry Connor, Michael López-Alegría, Mark Pathy, and Eytan Stibbe. The rocket took off from NASA’s Kennedy Space Center on Merritt Island in Florida.</p><p>Suffredini has been leading the charge at Axiom since the company first started in 2016. While Axiom Mission 1 is an Axiom venture, it wouldn’t be possible without the help of NASA and Elon Musk’s SpaceX.</p><p>Suffredini’s company is heading to ISS, which is a multi-nation hub orbiting 248 miles above ground.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-gIvpCV jBUmSX">Michael Suffredini worked at NASA's Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center.</h2><p>Suffredini is a former federal employee. He worked at the Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center prior to joining Axiom Space in 2016. He was a general engineer at the Houston-based agency and earned a reported base salary of $183,300 in 2015 before his departure. Suffredini spent about 11 years in that role, during which his earnings increased from a starting base salary of $145,600.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><h2 data-header=true class="sc-gIvpCV jBUmSX">Michael Suffredini’s estimated net worth is in the millions.</h2><p>Suffredini doesn't seem to be wealthy enough to land on platforms like Forbes or Bloomberg, which track multi-millionaires and billionaires. However, that doesn’t mean he isn't swimming in a decent amount of wealth. Suffredini was one of the highest-paid employees under NASA and has likely taken a notable pay bump since beginning his journey into privatized space travel. This includes base salary as well as equity, which he now gets rewarded with.</p><p>Because of his 11 years with a six-figure salary inching toward the $200,000 mark, Suffredini was already in a position to be a millionaire. That potential has skyrocketed with Axiom, where the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">highest salary is a reported $673,602</a> (presumably for Suffredini’s president and CEO role). That would put Suffredini’s six-year earnings at an estimated $4.041 million.</p><p>Suffredini’s estimated net worth is at least $4 million—assuming he doesn’t live beyond his plentiful means.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmilkae4psDRnpiloaOpe6S7zGinaKWZmLWisctmqq6elqeypbXNomSnnaRixLC%2B06Fm</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
