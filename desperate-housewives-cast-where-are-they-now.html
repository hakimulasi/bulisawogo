The Marc Cherry-created mystery comedy-drama made its debut on ABC October 3, 2004, with main cast members Teri Hatcher (Susan Mayer), Felicity Huffman (Lynette Scavo), Marcia Cross (Bree Van de Kamp) and Eva Longoria (Gabrielle Solis) playing a group of women living on the same fictional street.
The boundary-pushing show, which was narrated by Brenda Strong (as the late Mary Alice Young), became a massive success with viewers and TV critics alike."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

During its eight-season run, Desperate Housewives picked up countless accolades, including seven Primetime Emmys and three Golden Globe Awards.</p><p>When the series came to an end on May 13, 2012, it surpassed <a href=#>Charmed</a> as the longest-running hourlong TV show featuring all-female leads. In total, 180 episodes aired, topping the WB supernatural drama’s 178.</p><p>In addition to the core four, the ever-changing Desperate Housewives cast included <a href=#><strong>Nicollette Sheridan</strong></a> (Edie Britt), <a href=#><strong>Dana Delany</strong></a> (Katherine Mayfair), <a href=#><strong>Vanessa Williams</strong></a> (Renee Perry), <strong>Steven Culp</strong> (Rex Van de Kamp), <a href=#><strong>Ricardo Antonio Chavira</strong></a> (Carlos Solis), <a href=#><strong>James Denton</strong></a> (Mike Delfino), <a href=#><strong>Doug Savant</strong></a> (Tom Scavo) and <a href=#><strong>Kyle MacLachlan</strong></a> (Orson Hodge), among many others.</p><p>Five years after its finale, Longoria <a href=#>expressed interest in reuniting with her fellow housewives</a>, telling NewBeauty in December 2017 that she misses the show “every single day.”</p><p>She added: “I miss being Gaby. I miss being on that set. I miss everything about it.”</p><p>Amid the coronavirus pandemic in April 2020, <a href=#>some of the cast virtually reunited</a> to raise money for The Actors Fund, causing a bigger outcry for a real revival of the drama.</p><p>“We were a true dramedy,” the Devious Maids alum told fans during the video chat. “We were always a joke and then that gravity would take you by surprise, and that’s what I loved about the show — we got to do two things.”</p><p>Longoria continued: “We’ve all created these amazing friendships outside the show that are lasting forever.”</p><p>The following year, Cherry teased that a reboot could happen one day — but only if it felt like a natural continuation.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“With Desperate Housewives, I lucked out with that original cast and I had something to say with that show,” he told <a href=#>Entertainment Weekly</a> in November 2021. “If I was to do a reboot of it, I would have to come up with a brand-new idea of what fueled it. I know the formula, and it certainly would be great to try with more time and money.”</p><p>Keep scrolling to find out where the cast is now:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS9qq%2FTrqmeq1%2BZsrS8xKuYrZ1dnby2v8SwoK%2Bdo2Kwor%2FTZq6hnaKaeqK%2BxGaroZ2pYruww44%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
