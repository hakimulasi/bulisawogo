"At the time of filming, I didn't feel affected. The days were so hectic, and there wasn't enough time to think about it. When I did feel sad, I just thought about why we were doing it and the people we were doing it for. During upsetting scenes, we'd try to have a laugh and cheer each other up in between filming. We're all a big family at Corrie. It wasn't until I left the show, I realised the storyline had affected me emotionally. At this point, you've got to talk about it and process it in your mind – that's when it hit me personally."</span></p><p><span>McGlynn wants to raise awareness about things. She tells Revive that she pushed for her character on </span><i><span>Coronation Street </span></i><span>to have terminal cancer, to give people more information about it. "At first, it was unclear whether the cancer would be terminal or if Sinead would survive, but I wanted it to be terminal to raise awareness. While a lot of people do survive, a lot don't, and often on TV shows you don't see the true reality. With a platform like Coronation Street, it was an excellent opportunity to showcase the truth. We were in a great position to make a difference."</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/02/GettyImages-1436287028.jpg><p><span>In 2019, McGlynn decided to get healthier. She opened up about her journey on Instagram. One thing she did was work with a trainer, and shared what her weekly sessions were like in different posts. </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>In McGlynn's first post</span></a><span>, she wrote, "</span><span>First week of my Body Transformation at @up_north_pt. After a busy year of filming, my fitness has really taken a backseat and I don't feel 100% myself so I've decided it's time to hit the reset button. Over the next few months I'm challenging both my mind and body – solely focusing on my training and nutrition. I've trained at U.P. for years and completely fell in love with it, so I'm really excited to get stuck in again… but now under the watchful eye of @oliviadevall. I have definitely felt it this week. It's been really tough and I've noticed I'm not as strong as usual, but I am SO ready for this…bring it on!"</span><span aria-hidden=true>df44d9eab23ea271ddde7545ae2c09ec</span></p><p><span>To get in shape, McGlynn went on a diet plan. She talked about it in an interview with </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>Express</span></a><span>. "It was simple to follow the diet," she says. "There were no shakes, or packets of this or that. Just good fats, like salmon, eggs and nut butter. I don't eat red meat, and I've been having oats at night because they help me sleep."</span></p><p><span>McGlynn is committed to staying healthy. She tells Express that she plans on sticking with her new lifestyle, even after the plan ends. "</span><span>After my programme is finished, I won't stop. I'm going to carry on with it, because I have a taste for fitness now." McGlynn opened up about why she wants to keep this up. "I'm more confident than I've ever been, and I have more energy."</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo8PEpaNnm5%2BifK%2Bx1qxkpJmknrJuucKgo7KmnmK2r3nBmquhoZ6cerTByK1koZmjYq%2BttdKsna6kXai9onnDmrBo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
