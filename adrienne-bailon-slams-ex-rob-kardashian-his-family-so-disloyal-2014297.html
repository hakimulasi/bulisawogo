Adrienne Bailon told Latina magazine in its September 2014 issue that she’s tired of people ganging up on her about her ex-boyfriend, Rob Kardashian—especially because, according to the former Disney Channel star, he was the one who betrayed her.
Bailon, 30, who first rose to fame in the Cheetah Girls trilogy, dated Kardashian from 2007 to 2009. During that time, she starred briefly on Keeping Up With the Kardashians, but her stint on the show, according to Bailon, was not a savvy one."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

During that time, she starred briefly on Keeping Up With the Kardashians, but her stint on the show, according to Bailon, was not a savvy one.</p><p>“To be stuck with that Kardashian label, that was so hurtful to me and to my career,” Bailon said. “I probably realized that too late—not that it would’ve affected my decisions in terms of who I dated, but it would’ve affected my decision to appear on the show.”</p><p>Bailon, who was in her early 20s at the time, confessed to Latina that she didn’t think “anyone would even care.” But they did, and do. “To this day, people will still say, ‘<a href=#>You ruined Rob’s life!</a>‘” Bailon revealed, “and I’ll think, ‘Damn, I was still playing with Barbie dolls when I met him.'”</p><p>Being young was not the only pitfall of their relationship.</p><p>“It’s common knowledge that he cheated on me,” Bailon said of <strong><a href=#>Kris Jenner</a></strong>‘s <a href=#>only son</a>, 27. “It always bothered me that people were like, ‘Pero, why couldn’t you forgive him?'” She mused: “Why are women always the ones who have to forgive? If you cheated on a man, he would be like, ‘You’re disgusting, and I want nothing to do with you.’ But women, we’re supposed to be like, ‘He messed up. He made a mistake.'”</p><p>Reflecting on the hurt she endured after Rob’s betrayal, Bailon shared: “In my situation, it wasn’t like, ‘Oh my God! I made a mistake!’ He strategically planned things out so that he could cheat on me, and that to me was so disloyal.”</p><p><img decoding=async width=467 height=638 src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all" alt="adrienne bailon latina mag cover" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>As previously reported by <strong><a href=#>Us Weekly</a></strong>, Bailon is <a href=#>finally removing</a> her first love’s name from her body—five years after their split.</p><p>“I have not been in a relationship with Rob for six years,” Bailon <a href=#>told <strong>Us </strong>in mid-July</a>, “and I’ve been with my current boyfriend, [Roc Nation’s <strong>Lenny S.</strong>], for five years.
