"Initially, I thought it was going to be a bit of a boys club, but they weren't like that at all,"&nbsp;Mulligan told <a href=#>Entertainment Tonight</a>. "They were so sweet and so involving, and so hard working ... so serious, very conscientious, but so fun and silly at the same time,</p><p>Mulligan and DiCaprio had to kiss on screen, which she also had reservations about. However, she eventually became very comfortable with the act. "It's funny because when you're actually doing it — as a 12-year-old I probably would have been like, 'What is the 27-year-old [version of myself] doing?' It's actually weird, sort of awkward, kissing someone for the first time, and then it's just run of the mill," she said.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamllZn1ygo6lnKimkaexsHnDopqaqKKevLR50Z6jmqyZpLu0tMipqmavmam1brTIrGSlnZGZtq%2BzjKWYnaGVqHqmxM%2BlmKKmlZl8</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
