Rather than his last name, not much is given on the origins of Judas. He is referred to as Judas the son of Simon, but who Simon Iscariot was is unknown. What is known, however, is that Judas was the treasurer for Jesus and the other Apostles, but he was known to steal from the common purse from time to time, according to Britannica."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

After Jesus' death, according to the Gospel account, it is said that Judas felt guilty for his actions, returned the silver pieces, and killed himself. However, there are different variations of this story. In one version he returned the silver and hanged himself, whereas in another story he bought a field and threw himself down, and his bowels burst out from under him, according to Britannica.</p><p dir=ltr>If you or anyone you know is having suicidal thoughts, please call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline by dialing 988 or by calling 1-800-273-TALK (8255)​.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunB9j2pna3FpZMSpu4ywmKxlmqqxor%2BMoqqcmaKevLV506GcZpyZqLCqvMueZLCgn2KvpsDRmrCenF2fsrTB0maaoaqZqMFw</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
