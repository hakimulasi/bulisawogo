I try to avoid all commercials and most trailers. One theater that I attend has a firm policy of NO commercials and THREE trailers (maximum). (This is the Ritz 16 in Voorhees, NJ, for anyone who lives in the area.) That's the only place where I plan to arrive before the start time. For a Loews or an AMC, unless I expect a sellout, I get there about 10 minutes AFTER the printed start time.</p><p>I am not a "trailer person." I don't download them, I don't hunt on-line for them, and I don't feel cheated if I miss them before a movie. Why don't I like them? To a lesser extent, it's because there's little or no art in how most trailers are put together. In any given year, there are a handful of trailers worth seeing. Everything else is garbage.</p><p>But there's a bigger reason why I don't like trailers. They give everything away. Half the time, after viewing a 2-3 minute trailer, I feel like I have seen the movie. Trailers for comedies give away the best jokes, trailers for action/thrillers reveal big hints about twists and the ending, and dramas tell the whole story. Trailers are the visual equivalent of "spoilers" and I'm not a big fan of having movies spoiled. (Having said that, if I'm sitting in a theater and trailers are shown, I rarely close my eyes or turn away unless I know it's a movie I don't want to know anything about.)</p><p>I respect trailers that tease without revealing much. (These are usually, appropriately, called "teaser trailers" and typically appear to hype a movie before the film is in a complete enough form for a full trailer to be made.) The early trailers for the Emmerich/Devlin <i>Godzilla</i> were brilliant. Ditto for the first glimpses of Barry Levinson's <i>Toys</i>. The <i>Star Wars</i> teasers have been pretty good, although they still show more than I would prefer.</p><p>But I know I'm in a minority. Downloading trailers is a big deal. There are people who willingly sit through all those multiplex commercials just so they don't miss any trailers. And, when the <i>Revenge of the Sith</i> trailer made its TV debut (during an episode of the Fox series, "The O.C."), it was advertised. That's right: Fox was running ads for an ad!</p><p>I would love it if the marketing people in Hollywood would start putting some real effort into producing trailers. Make them worth seeing. Don't spoil the movie. But until that happens, I will continue to regard trailers with the same disdain that I view the Coke, Pepsi, and Best Buy commercial that precede them on multiplex screens. I go to theaters to see a movie, not a bunch of coming attractions.</p><p>And there are two side issues which I won't get into (at least not today). How many trailers is too many? I have seen as many as nine or ten before some movies. That's more than 20 minutes of trailers. And who wants to be forced to skip through a trailer at the beginning of a DVD? Any time I pay money for something (movie ticket, DVD), I don't expect to be inconvenienced by commercials, regardless of whether or not they're called "trailers."</p><span class=st_twitter_large displaytext=Tweet></span> <span class=st_facebook_large displaytext=Facebook></span> <span class=st_googleplus_large displaytext="Google +"></span> <span class=st_email_large displaytext=Email></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7HEpa2inaeoe6%2Bx02ipnp2cqbWwwcahq6xnpJ2ybq3RrWSoql2hrqS3jK2fnqqVpLNuu8Vmq6GdXam%2ForXLnqk%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
