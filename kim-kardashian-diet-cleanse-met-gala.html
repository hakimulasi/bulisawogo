I'm SO excited to do this, you guys, but I definitely need to mentally prepare, lol. I have the Met Gala coming up and I've worked so hard working out, but I started eating a lot of sweets and I wanted to just change my food patterns to eat healthier and cut sugar out of my life as much as I can. We always have sweets around and it's really hard when there are temptations everywhere."</p><p id=eblz5W8EGWcS><a class=hm-link href=#>STORY: This is how Kim Kardashian toned her famous curves</a></p><p id=e00mWCVymyUA data-wc=73>She continued: "I already completed day one and two of the cleanse, and I've been surrounded by doughnuts, but I stayed away. I'm so proud of myself! I wanted to do this cleanse because the food looked so filling and there are only three days that you just drink liquids. This is seriously not a sponsored thing, I just really wanted to try it. I'll keep you updated on how I like it."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/794d2cbc8537-kim-kardashian-holiday-turks-and-caicos-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=ep1n13ypzJdE data-wc=14><strong>The mum-of-three showcased her toned figure on a recent holiday in Turks and Caicos</strong></p><p id=eD5PvbKbGBxm data-wc=81>Kim recently revealed that she has been working with celebrity trainer Melissa Alcantara to tone her curves, following a mix of low-intensity and high-intensity interval training with weight training to shred fat and build lean muscle.
