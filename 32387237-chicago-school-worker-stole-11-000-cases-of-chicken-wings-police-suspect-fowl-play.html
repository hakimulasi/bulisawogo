The manager found the district was $300,000 over its annual food service budget despite only being halfway through the school year, according to prosecutors.</p><p>“She discovered individual invoices signed by Liddell for massive quantities of chicken wings, an item that was never served to students because they contain bones,” prosecutors said.</p><p>Court records say employees of the district’s food provider, Gordon Food Service, were all familiar with the defendant “due to the massive amount of chicken wings she would purchase.”</p><p>The case was investigated by the Cook County State’s Attorney’s office and Liddell was charged with theft.
