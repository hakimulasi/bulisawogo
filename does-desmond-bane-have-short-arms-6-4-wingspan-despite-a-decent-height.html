Bane can get off the ground, but lateral quickness is not one of his strong suits.</p><p>He puts a lot of effort on the floor, which will benefit him, but getting in the lane off the dribble or guarding a speedy player will be much more difficult in the NBA.</p><p>Critics&nbsp;claimed that NBA point guards might be too quick for him, and a substantial percentage of small forwards may be too tall.</p><p>Overall, they concluded that he has a lot of upsides, but he’s a guy who can probably contribute to the NBA for a long time.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-much-net-worth-is-desmond-bane-making-from-his-current-team></span>How Much Net Worth Is Desmond Bane Making From His Current Team?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Desmond Bane has an average salary of $2,486,231 from the Memphis Grizzlers as per&nbsp;spotrac.com, which has uplifted his net worth.</p><p>He is in a 4-year contract with the Grizzlers and has a guaranteed salary of $9,944,923.
